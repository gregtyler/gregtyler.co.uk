        I&#8217;m a front-end web developer and designer, with the odd bit
        of full stack. I work for the University of Edinburgh creating
        various academic and corporate systems, most of them hidden away
        from the public. I work on a bunch of side projects like a
        <a href="https://gregtyler.gitlab.io/simply-notes/"
          >note-taking app</a
        >
        and tools for
        <a href="https://bevisinlondon.com/">digital humanities</a>.
