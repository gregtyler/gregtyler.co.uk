  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ &quot;And that&#39;s when I decided: I hated
  Christmas.&quot; states Martin Freeman in the film&#39;s cold opening.
  In my book, a lack of Christmas spirit is just as good as plentiful
  amounts of it: it allows us to believe the character can change, can
  grow to love Christmas, and it&#39;s very hard to do that without
  injecting them with Christmas charm!
</p>
<p>
  Sadly, some of the Christmas spirit <em>Nativity!</em> has is somewhat
  spoiled by the fact that it looks like it was shot in a damp British
  autumn, not a winter wonderland. Of course, being the UK, it could
  have equally been a fairly mild winter. Ultimately, some fake snow
  wouldn&#39;t have gone amiss.

    They all just found out they&#39;re going to meet Ricky Tomlinson!

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ A pretty stellar British cast list, as you might expect from
  BBC films, pitting Martin Freeman against the wonderful villain Jason
  Watkins portrays. But the devil is in the details, as Ricky Tomlinson
  plays mayor, Alan Carr is a suitably bitchy critic and other familiar
  UK faces pop in for a few lines.
</p>
<p>
  However, it&#39;s the children who really make the film. A fantastic
  ensemble, they get all the best jokes and seem to love singing and
  dancing around the school. Despite the size of the class, many
  students come into their own with lovely back-stories and silly
  characters.

<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ It&#39;s about a school nativity play, so unsurprisingly
  everyone in the family can enjoy it. There are a couple of fart jokes
  for the kids, and adorable children to bring ear-to-ear grins to
  adults&#39; faces.
</p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Again, the subject matter of the film gives a slight
  advantage here. It&#39;s full of songs about the story of the
  nativity, a lot of them written exclusively. Whilst you could complain
  it lacks the &quot;classics&quot;, there&#39;s no denying that
  children singing about how Mary and Joseph fell in love is pretty darn
  seasonal!
</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br /><em>Nativity!</em> will bring joy to your heart and a
  tear to your eye, just as you might expect. It&#39;s also very funny,
  so has the honourable pleasure of making me cry both with laughter and
  emotions. I hadn&#39;t heard of this film before, and it was
  recommended to me by someone at
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pleasancepubquiz">the quiz</a>. Now
  I recommend it to all of you, because it&#39;s really wonderful.
</p>
<p>
  The word &quot;adorable&quot; just doesn&#39;t go this film justice.
