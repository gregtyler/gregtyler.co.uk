        <h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ &quot;And that&#39;s when I decided: I hated
          Christmas.&quot; states Martin Freeman in the film&#39;s cold opening.
          In my book, a lack of Christmas spirit is just as good as plentiful
          amounts of it: it allows us to believe the character can change, can
          grow to love Christmas, and it&#39;s very hard to do that without
          injecting them with Christmas charm!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly, some of the Christmas spirit <em>Nativity!</em> has is somewhat
          spoiled by the fact that it looks like it was shot in a damp British
          autumn, not a winter wonderland. Of course, being the UK, it could
          have equally been a fairly mild winter. Ultimately, some fake snow
          wouldn&#39;t have gone amiss.

            They all just found out they&#39;re going to meet Ricky Tomlinson!
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ A pretty stellar British cast list, as you might expect from
          BBC films, pitting Martin Freeman against the wonderful villain Jason
          Watkins portrays. But the devil is in the details, as Ricky Tomlinson
          plays mayor, Alan Carr is a suitably bitchy critic and other familiar
          UK faces pop in for a few lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it&#39;s the children who really make the film. A fantastic
          ensemble, they get all the best jokes and seem to love singing and
          dancing around the school. Despite the size of the class, many
          students come into their own with lovely back-stories and silly
          characters.
        </p>
        <h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ It&#39;s about a school nativity play, so unsurprisingly
          everyone in the family can enjoy it. There are a couple of fart jokes
          for the kids, and adorable children to bring ear-to-ear grins to
          adults&#39; faces.
        </p>
        <h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Again, the subject matter of the film gives a slight
          advantage here. It&#39;s full of songs about the story of the
          nativity, a lot of them written exclusively. Whilst you could complain
          it lacks the &quot;classics&quot;, there&#39;s no denying that
          children singing about how Mary and Joseph fell in love is pretty darn
          seasonal!
        </p>
        <h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br /><em>Nativity!</em> will bring joy to your heart and a
          tear to your eye, just as you might expect. It&#39;s also very funny,
          so has the honourable pleasure of making me cry both with laughter and
          emotions. I hadn&#39;t heard of this film before, and it was
          recommended to me by someone at
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pleasancepubquiz">the quiz</a>. Now
          I recommend it to all of you, because it&#39;s really wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word &quot;adorable&quot; just doesn&#39;t go this film justice.
