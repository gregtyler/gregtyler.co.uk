  As it has done the past few years, Facebook tried to make a
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yearinreview/TheGregTyler"
    >Year in Review</a
  >
  for me. There are a couple of reasons this doesn&#39;t work:
  Facebook&#39;s algorithms are squiffy and I don&#39;t post enough
  important life events to it (either that or I supremely underestimated
  the importance of some events). In a retaliation of sorts, I decided
  to make my own Year in Review which actually makes sense.
</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>
  In July, and after struggling mentally to complete fourth year, I
  graduated from Edinburgh University. Strangely, my degree title was a
  &quot;Master of Arts in Mathematics&quot;, which is totally possible
  in Scotland. Months later I would discover that technically I
  didn&#39;t fulfil the requirements for that title, something I can
  hopefully prevent from happening in the future at my new job.

  It&#39;s been a funny change, not spending every day with those same
  people. I still see plenty of them, and regularly, but it&#39;s not
  quite the same. Everyone says you make your best friends at University
  and so far it looks like that&#39;s pretty true.
</p>
<h2 id="employment">Employment</h2>
<p>
  A week after graduating, I started work at the University I&#39;d just
  left. After eighteen years at the sharp end of education, I&#39;ve
  moved behind the curtain to help make that experience happen for
  others. I&#39;m working as part of Development Services, making and
  maintaining the various University web services. In particular,
  I&#39;ve been continuing to work with
  <a href="http://path.is.ed.ac.uk/">Path</a>, the course selection
  application I was previously involved in as a student.

<p>
  It&#39;s been fun becoming part of the &quot;real world&quot;, and
  I&#39;ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by very warm, friendly and
  intelligent people who&#39;ve helped with the transition.
</p>
<p>
  On the subject of Path, me and Paul got to speak about it at the
  <a
    href="http://www.enhancementthemes.ac.uk/events/enhancement-themes-conference"
    >Enhancement Themes</a
  >
  conference in Glasgow, which was a fascinating insight into the world
  of curriculum development in Higher Education. It also made us aware
  of how exciting Path was, not just for our institution but around the
  country as well. A lot of the conference went way over our heads, but
  to be allowed to take part was a great experience.
</p>
<h2 id="websites">Websites</h2>
<p>
  I released my
  <a href="http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/">playground</a> this year, which
  I&#39;m planning to use for one-shot websites and gags. On there
  already is the
  <a href="http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/upworthy/"
    >Upworthy Headline Generator</a
  >
  which I knocked together in an afternoon and am quite proud of.
  There&#39;s also
  <a href="http://gharmony.gregtyler.co.uk/">gHarmony</a>, my
  <em>very</em> personal dating site which hasn&#39;t had particularly
  positive results yet.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/blog/introducing-quizzard">Quizzard</a> has had a really good
  year. I haven&#39;t been developing it too actively, but it&#39;s now
  been used for almost 40 quizzes and has over 1500 questions on it.
  I&#39;ve pushed a few enhancements for editing, and introduced the
  ability to automatically generate slide shows. I haven&#39;t made any
  advances to making Quizzard more public, but it&#39;s still somewhere
  in my mind that I&#39;d like to.
</p>
<p>
  Now in its third year,
  <a href="http://talklikeapoirotday.co.uk/">Talk Like a Poirot Day</a>
  went down well again, reaching thousands of people and doing very well
  on social networks. Whereas TLAPD used to be something only me and
  friends published about, this year I was amazed to see people from all
  over the world with no link to me posting on Facebook and tweeting
  about the event. We still haven&#39;t caught the eye of any low-stream
  media sites to my knowledge, which makes this all feel like an
  underground sect.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/">This very site</a> was
  launched just before Christmas last year (first blog post 14th
  December 2012), but only really came into proper use over the past
  twelve months. I&#39;ve published a real mix of content, from
  <a
    href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/much-ado-about-noetherian-rings/"
    >Shakespearian verse</a
  >
  to
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/hellcats/">reviewing TV shows</a

  >
  to
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/britains-most-northerly-sheep/"
    >safari in the Shetland islands</a
  >. I&#39;ve got some plans to redesign the site a bit, and should
  probably point out again the inspiration I&#39;ve got from
  <a href="http://www.polygon.com/">Polygon</a>, who continue to show
  that editorial content can embrace beautiful design.
</p>
<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>
<p>
  The Pleasance Quiz continues to go strong, pulling in students from
  all years and a few graduates too. We&#39;ve rearranged the rounds a
  couple of times in the past year and will probably do so again at some
  point to keep things fresh. Writing questions was much easier as a
  student when I had so much free time in the days, but I still find
  time to write mindless trivia, normally while watching the F1. We lost
  quizmaster Innes from the quiz in the second half of the year as he
  had to go on placement as part of his studies, making way for
  quizmaster Angus &#8211; who hosts the other EUSA quizzes &#8211; to
  join our stage. He hasn&#39;t done anything too embarrassing yet.
</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>
  This is probably the bit of my life that Facebook summed up best,
  unsurprisingly. As our final year drew a close, all the right effort
  was made to see everyone as much as possible.

  Particular kudos go to the Maths Ball, and the many days of summer
  spent sitting on the Meadows with beer and slack lines. I was also
  lucky enough to see my friend&#39;s wedding, the first I&#39;d been
  to. It was a lovely, special day that cemented the fact we&#39;d all
  become grown-ups.
</p>
<p>
  Of course there was also the Edinburgh Fringe which, as ever, brought
  a host of friends back to sleep on our sofas and enjoy some of the
  best (and, let&#39;s be honest, worst) comedy, theatre and music on
  offer. My fourth year in the Fringe, this is certainly the one I spent
  the most money on going to shows, bringing me to the realisation that
  paid shows are much preferable to the free ones I used to go to.
</p>
<h2 id="going-home">Going Home</h2>
<p>
  Throughout 2012 I didn&#39;t go home at all, even at Christmas. So it
  was great to revisit Bristol in November this year. I owe a lot to the
  city and people there, who really helped mould me into the man I am
  today. As well as seeing my parents and catching up with the locals
  (enjoying a few evenings in the pub down the road, of course), the
  trip centred around two events: a trip to Cardiff and a late Guy
  Fawkes night planned months in advance.

<p>
  The Cardiff trip was mainly to visit
  <a href="http://www.doctorwhoexperience.com/"
    >The Doctor Who Experience</a
  >
  (in stark contrast to all those going visiting for the international
  rugby that day) with a group of former Young Leaders from my old Scout
  group. We&#39;re spread all around the country now, so it&#39;s been a
  few years since we last got the five of us together in one place. It
  amazes me that, after we&#39;ve all gone off to different Universities
  in different cities, gone on to different jobs and to lead different
  lives, we can still all just meet in a room and talk at each other for
  hours.
</p>
<p>
  The Doctor Who Experience itself was really good, I highly recommend
  it. It&#39;s been very well put together and is just as slick as you
  would expect any BBC production spin-off to be. There is (or perhaps
  was) the option to look around the set of the TARDIS as well, which I
  recommend from the point-of-view of a fan of the show and of someone
  who loves intelligent TV filming.
</p>
<p>
  The late Guy Fawkes night was spent with an old friend and their
  family and friends. Messing about with sparklers and &quot;magic
  mushrooms&quot; is totally under-rated.

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>
  2013 was a year of development. Moving away from learning and into
  working; moving away from many friends; starting to work on websites
  more formally and completely. I&#39;m not sure what 2014 will involve,
  and am particularly aware that I may settle further into this city or
  move to a new one to face new challenges. But I hope I can continue to
  live the rich social life I&#39;ve grown accustomed to, and go on
  developing interesting new websites that help and entertain people.
