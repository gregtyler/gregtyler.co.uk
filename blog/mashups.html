          As we come to the end of the year, it&#39;s time to all write our
          reviews of the most important events. The best films, the best clothes
          and, of course, the best mashups.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may know, I&#39;m a huge fan of mashups. I can&#39;t really
          explain why, but there&#39;s something amazing about listening to two
          songs at once. In particular, I love hearing a classic track with
          something new over the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been some great mashups this year and I wanted to pay
          tribute to some of the best. I was going to rank a Top 3, but I&#39;ve
          opted to just list some and not worry about which was the best.
          Because mashups aren&#39;t about picking a favourite, they&#39;re
          about enjoying as many favourites as you can at once!

          Porter Robinson&#39;s Language was one of my top tunes of the summer.
          It got into the radio, into clubs and still sits on my mp3 player.
          Meanwhile, Call Me Maybe was in everyone&#39;s hearts for all sorts of
          reasons. For me, it was the soundtrack to
          <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu9qTMDZ2ww"
            >Freshers&#39; Week</a
          >, where volunteering was my highlight of the year. All said, it&#39;s
          no surprise that this crossover features on my favourites list.
          It&#39;s simple, but it&#39;s lovely.

          This mashup dropped at just the right time, right before Halloween.
          The combination of &quot;currently popular track&quot; and
          &quot;Halloween classic&quot; was an inspired idea, and I know that it
          played at parties across the world. I seem to recall that
          <a href="http://www.freshair.org.uk/">Fresh Air</a> and
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebigcheese.ed">The Big Cheese</a>
          were big fans too. The thing that really makes this track though, in
          my eyes, is the build-up you get. It&#39;s obvious for the first
          minute or so what&#39;s coming up, but when he finally shouts
          &quot;Oppa! Gangnam Style&quot; at 1:21, it feels like the perfect
          setup.

          Okay, so this isn&#39;t a mashup per s√©. This half hour track by The
          Cut Up Boys combines some of the best songs in recent times, and mixes
          them all incredibly. I saw The Cut Up Boys live this year and it was
          one of the best gigs I can remember. They played a long set and the
          mixing was truly sublime. I&#39;ve listened through this particular
          mix several times and thrown it on at parties and events too. It
          always gets a great response.

        <p>
          Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a sample of this to play, but it was
          still one of my favourite mashups of the year. The lead-in to
          Greyhound goes on for a minute or so, which is just about long enough
          to mix in a verse of Professional Griefers by deadmau5. Then, just as
          Greyhound drops in, so too does the chorus of Professional Griefers.
          It&#39;s a very simple mashup (since they have the same BPM, you just
          play one over the top of t&#39;other), but it just damn works.
        </p>

          So there you are: some great mashups of 2012. I&#39;d love to also
          compile a list of some of my favourite tracks of the year, but it
          would just go on and on. But I can&#39;t leave that so dry, so
          here&#39;s a bonus few highlights of 2012 songs:
