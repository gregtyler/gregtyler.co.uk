  People often ask me* &quot;Greg, what music are you listening to at
  the moment?&quot; And I, of course, always reply with
  &quot;Scooter!&quot; But then, sometimes, I listen to something other
  than the mesmerising hard techno jumpstyle of H.P. Baxxter et al. So
  here are some recommendations of albums I&#39;ve been enjoying of
  late. They&#39;re not necessarily new, but hopefully some of them will
  be new to you!
</p>
<p>
  Most song/album links are to Spotify, but many will be available on
  other services too!

</h2>
<p>
  I came across Woodkid through the amazing
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmc21V-zBq0"
    >video for Run Boy Run</a
  >, which is a combination of powerful music and great cinematography.
  The rest of The Golden Age really keeps up with Run Boy Run, which was
  great to discover, and makes great use of strong drum beats, vocals
  and horns.

    Kerfuffle may have split up, but their music is still well worth a
    listen!

    >Kerfuffle &#8211; To The Ground</a

</h2>
<p>
  There&#39;s a lot of buzz around folk music these days, which I think
  is fantastic. Meanwhile, Kerfuffle were one of the first folk bands I
  really fell in love with through their album K2; so I was delighted to
  find that one of their more recent albums is Spotify-ready. Particular
  favourite tracks are &quot;Dr Letcher&#39;s Favourite&quot; and
  &quot;Rondo&quot;. If you&#39;re into your Newton Faulkner and Mumford
  &amp; Sons, why not try something a bit more traditional?

  This album is crazy. It sort of tells the story of some weird
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_(franchise)"
    >Knight Rider</a
  >
  scenario where a car and man bond together into one and produce
  wonderful electronic music. I was recommended this album ages ago but
  forgot about it until a couple of weeks ago when I heard
  <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/73bDvrmSBh2fr53tLDH9oA"
    >Nightcall</a
  >
  at a bar and insisted a friend Shazam&#39;d it. I&#39;m sure this
  album isn&#39;t for everyone but I really love it.

</h2>
<p>
  I really enjoy progressive house music, and in my eyes this album
  contains some of the best tracks going. I shan&#39;t dwell because
  it&#39;s pretty well-known and quite dividing. But if you like EDM and
  haven&#39;t got round to &gt; album title goes here &lt; yet,
  now&#39;s a great time.

</h2>
<p>
  This is a trance album from 2011, but it still pulls its weight. Some
  fantastic songs on here, and the flow throughout it is really good.
  Anjunabeats is the name of Above &amp; Beyond&#39;s record label, and
  this album contains of some of the label&#39;s best tracks from 2011.
