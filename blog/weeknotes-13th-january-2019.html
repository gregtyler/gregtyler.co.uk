        <p>
          Two important things are happening in OPG Digital at the moment:
          various new staff are joining us, and it&#8217;s the start of the
          calendar year. So naturally, we&#8217;re having a lot of good
          conversations about what 2020 has in store for our services, platform,
          way of working etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The upshot of this for me personally has been a selection of planning
          meetings, writing and refining tickets. We&#8217;re planning major new
          features, important rewrites and integrations across OPG services.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this leads to fairly mixed emotions: I&#8217;m excited to look
          ahead at the work we&#8217;ll do, some of which is going to open so
          many great opportunities, but nervous about the amount of effort and
          risk we&#8217;ll be taking on. I think pacing will be important: we
          need to get better at finishing epics before we move onto the next
          ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other nice side of this is working across different products and
          service teams to plan and communicate our plans. This week I&#8217;ve
          been actively developing two products and planning across two more.
          It&#8217;s meant working with new colleagues and picking up new
          skills, which is always awesome.
        </p>
