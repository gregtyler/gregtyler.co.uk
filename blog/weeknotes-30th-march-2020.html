        <p>
          This is one of those weeks I forgot to write weeknotes, so I&#8217;m
          doing a quick summary.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ve done a bunch of cleanup tasks this week: deleting old code,
          rewriting to modern standards, overcoming deprecations. It&#8217;s
          good work, though leads to so quite terrifying PRs (if you&#8217;re
          removed 1,000 lines of code, are you sure they&#8217;re the right
          ones?!)
        </p>

        <p>
          I also wrote a whole load of tickets related to an accessibility audit
          we had. This picked up on some really good things: some major
          rewrites, some quick fixes. We&#8217;ll play them in the coming weeks
          as we get availability.
        </p>

        <p>
          This week&#8217;s work wraps up the &#8220;move to GOV.UK
          Notify&#8221; epic, which is good to have out of the way. &#8220;Court
          orders&#8221;, &#8220;Upgrade Symfony&#8221;, &#8220;Audit
          logging&#8221; and &#8220;Accessibility audit&#8221; are just around
          the corner, but hopefully we won&#8217;t have too many in play at
          once.
        </p>

        <p>
          And integrations work continues apace, with hopes that the majority of
          the hard work is now behind us.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Removed old email code: this was far reaching and caused a real mess
            in some places. Now we use a single HTTP-based API, a lot of our
            security configuration is simplified too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tidied up how we inject services in Symfony. This was a requirement
            for the v4 upgrade and a satisfying piece of work in general.
          </li>
          <li>Integrations bug fixes and tweaks</li>
          <li>
            Started building a Node/Express API for a extra curricular project
            to do with quizzes (which takes me back to my
