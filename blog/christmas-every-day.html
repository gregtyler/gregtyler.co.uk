summary: Billy Jackson is basically tortured by Santa Claus to relive Christmas until he likes it. This is the Stockholm Syndrome of Christmas films.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ The Christmas spirit on display here is that of small-town
  America: where the neighbours all know each other, and the community
  gets together to watch its members tell the nativity story, as they do
  every year. It&#39;s sweet, but Billy Jackson&#39;s having none of it.
</p>
<p>
  As you might expect, Billy learns to change his ways. However,
  he&#39;s initially driven much more by a desire to get out of the
  infernal loop than to actually spread good-will unto all men. His
  final day and escaping comes, I think, out of that desire, with the
  good deeds a fortunate by-product. In the end, he&#39;s a changed man,
  but perhaps not for the right reasons.

  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The acting in this isn&#39;t exemplary. The main kid fulfils
  his role reasonably, but perhaps just because an angsty teen
  doesn&#39;t have to stretch too far to portray an angsty teen. A nice
  surprise for me was seeing
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001332/">Robert Hays</a> in a
  production over than <em>Airplane!</em> which, until now, was my only
  knowledge of his work.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Again, this film pushes a bit too hard into being
  anti-Christmas. Billy&#39;s uncle, aunt and cousins come over, and
  there&#39;s quite some tension there, as there is with his school
  bully. Whilst these are overcome, because of the repetitive nature of
  these living-the-same-day-over-and-over films, we are reintroduced to
  the situation every fifteen minutes or so and reminded of just
  <em>why</em> Billy wants to get back at the bully. That tension takes
  it down in the family fun rankings.
</p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Fair enough work put in here: there are some carol singers
  who show up occasionally and there&#39;s the singing at the nativity
  pageant, as well as a rollicking song around the piano! All good
  stuff. The only caveat here is that, again due to the film&#39;s
  nature, you hear the same songs over and over again. But then,
  that&#39;s fairly in keeping with the Christmas spirit. Indeed,
  it&#39;s now Wizzard&#39;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas
  Everyday&quot; that we <em>do</em> hear everyday, and this review
  neatly wraps itself up, like some sort of prepared Christmas present.
</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br/>I think these sort of repeating-a-day films should be
  really easy to write. <em>Groundhog Day</em> is top of the class,
  pushing out a bit and doing something interesting with it.
  <em>Christmas Every Day</em> is near the other end of the spectrum:
  it&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s just quite plain. As Billy discovers
  problems, you can be guaranteed he&#39;ll fix them by the end of the
  film, and there are no surprises along the way. It&#39;s fine for a
  bit of Christmas escapism though.
