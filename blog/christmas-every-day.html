        <h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ The Christmas spirit on display here is that of small-town
          America: where the neighbours all know each other, and the community
          gets together to watch its members tell the nativity story, as they do
          every year. It&#39;s sweet, but Billy Jackson&#39;s having none of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might expect, Billy learns to change his ways. However,
          he&#39;s initially driven much more by a desire to get out of the
          infernal loop than to actually spread good-will unto all men. His
          final day and escaping comes, I think, out of that desire, with the
          good deeds a fortunate by-product. In the end, he&#39;s a changed man,
          but perhaps not for the right reasons.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The acting in this isn&#39;t exemplary. The main kid fulfils
          his role reasonably, but perhaps just because an angsty teen
          doesn&#39;t have to stretch too far to portray an angsty teen. A nice
          surprise for me was seeing
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001332/">Robert Hays</a> in a
          production over than <em>Airplane!</em> which, until now, was my only
          knowledge of his work.
        </p>
        <h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Again, this film pushes a bit too hard into being
          anti-Christmas. Billy&#39;s uncle, aunt and cousins come over, and
          there&#39;s quite some tension there, as there is with his school
          bully. Whilst these are overcome, because of the repetitive nature of
          these living-the-same-day-over-and-over films, we are reintroduced to
          the situation every fifteen minutes or so and reminded of just
          <em>why</em> Billy wants to get back at the bully. That tension takes
          it down in the family fun rankings.
        </p>
        <h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Fair enough work put in here: there are some carol singers
          who show up occasionally and there&#39;s the singing at the nativity
          pageant, as well as a rollicking song around the piano! All good
          stuff. The only caveat here is that, again due to the film&#39;s
          nature, you hear the same songs over and over again. But then,
          that&#39;s fairly in keeping with the Christmas spirit. Indeed,
          it&#39;s now Wizzard&#39;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas
          Everyday&quot; that we <em>do</em> hear everyday, and this review
          neatly wraps itself up, like some sort of prepared Christmas present.
        </p>
        <h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I think these sort of repeating-a-day films should be
          really easy to write. <em>Groundhog Day</em> is top of the class,
          pushing out a bit and doing something interesting with it.
          <em>Christmas Every Day</em> is near the other end of the spectrum:
          it&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s just quite plain. As Billy discovers
          problems, you can be guaranteed he&#39;ll fix them by the end of the
          film, and there are no surprises along the way. It&#39;s fine for a
          bit of Christmas escapism though.
