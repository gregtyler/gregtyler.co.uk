        <p>This week I tried to handle my stress.</p>

        <p>
          The last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been quite stressed. My new
          service involves working on a vast existing stack which is
          intimidating and recognised as being a bit janky.
        </p>

        <p>
          A bit of background: a few years ago we thought it would be sensible
          to build two back-office systems into one stack. It would mean sharing
          common code and allow developers to work across both systems at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          Years later we regret it. The two systems simply aren&#8217;t similar
          enough and we&#8217;re now inextricably tied together. Product
          decisions are hard to make because they typically affect both
          services.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it&#8217;s a nightmare as a developer. I&#8217;ve found myself
          trying to fix bugs only to cause them for a team working on something
          different. I&#8217;ve had to negotiate changes with other teams. Our
          release schedule is tied to other services (so e.g. there&#8217;s no
          hotfix process available).
        </p>

        <p>
          Add to that the multiple technologies, libraries and patterns, and it
          feels like stumbling around in a dark room full of mousetraps.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, I&#8217;m surrounded by a great team who I trust. So I
          can deal with this stress rather than letting it hurt me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, I told everyone about it. It&#8217;s easy to feel weak or
          vulnerable when stressed, but it&#8217;s an indication that something
          in the business is wrong. If you feel uneasy speaking up, then the
          stress will never dissipate, you&#8217;ll resent your job, and
          it&#8217;ll hurt you worse.
        </p>

        <p>
          I talked to my team, close colleagues and our lead developer. They
          were all supportive and keen to understand the cause of the stress so
          that could help resolve it. Just feeling like people were on my side
          helped me personally, and I&#8217;m sure it will lead to other
          decisions to help move forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly, I tried to identify the root causes of my stress.
          That&#8217;s hard, because the very nature of stress makes it
          difficult to focus and, frankly, everything feels awful. I made
          progress by writing notes of my concerns, then a few days later
          reviewing them and narrowing them down further. Ultimately it came
          down to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Feeling like I was doing bad quality work</li>
          <li>Having too much responsibility</li>
          <li>Not having enough ownership</li>
          <li>Worrying about getting in others&#8217; way</li>
          <li>Not having an opportunity to develop myself and my skills</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Lastly, I spoke to my line manager and principal developer. He
          encouraged me to go back to focusing on problems and solving them,
          because that&#8217;s what we do.
        </p>

        <p>
          And, ultimately, my stress seems to come to a simple solution: we need
          to smash this codebase in half and separate the two systems. It
          won&#8217;t be easy, or fast, but it benefits the business and deals
          with my causes of stress:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Building components from scratch, I can build them to my standards
          </li>
          <li>
            I&#8217;ll be responsible only for our service, not the other one
          </li>
          <li>
            I&#8217;ll (we&#8217;ll) have direct ownership, rather than
            awkwardly sharing it with others
          </li>
          <li>There won&#8217;t be other teams/services to bump into</li>
          <li>
            There&#8217;ll be lots of new work and I can identify opportunities
            to improve myself
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That conversation was yesterday, so I&#8217;m still digesting my
          new-found clarity. But it&#8217;s a good place to start.
        </p>

        <p>Next week I&#8217;ll focus on a few things</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Getting buy-in from colleagues that we need to look at splitting
          </li>
          <li>Documenting the problems splitting will solve</li>
          <li>Identifying opportunities to easily split the codebase</li>
          <li>
            Identifying dependencies and blockers that might inhibit splitting
            or the order in which we do it
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My worry now is that all of that might lead to <em>more</em> stress.
          But I&#8217;m starting to develop the tools to manage and handle that,
          and hope I can use them again to focus on what I can do right now and
          document the rest.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ll hopefully update in a couple of weeks in how that&#8217;s
          going.
