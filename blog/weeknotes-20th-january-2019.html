        <p>
          This week I spent more time than I&#8217;d like fixing the basics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past week or two I&#8217;ve been working on Serve OPG, an
          internal service of ours. It&#8217;s a simple little service which
          required some important but fairly small changes. Unfortunately, we
          came across a bunch of issues when trying to release the work that
          we&#8217;ve had to spend time fixing: pipelines not working, flaky
          tests, misconfigured environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Obviously these are good things to fix, but I hate doing this work
          unanticipated. It&#8217;s a big time sink, and a massive distraction.
          It affects morale and gets in the way of other sprint work, knocking
          back estimates and deadlines.
        </p>

        <p>
          The important thing is that it&#8217;s done, but this has been a harsh
          reminder of what happens when you let things fall into disrepair. If
          we&#8217;d taken the time to look at and fix this earlier, it
          wouldn&#8217;t have been as arresting, we would&#8217;ve appreciated
          the value, and I think we would have spent less time on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what am I doing to improve it? Firstly, I&#8217;m trying to be more
          aware of my surroundings when planning work. Implementing changes may
          be easy, but tests, side effects and CI/CD have to be considered too.
          We run a fully integrated DevOps cycle, so I can&#8217;t just estimate
          the dev time and throw the rest over the fence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, I&#8217;m going to endeavour to appreciate and communicate the
          value of fixing the basics. Spending two days &#8220;tidying our
          pipeline&#8221; may seem like lost time, but if it speeds up all
          future builds then we&#8217;ll quickly make the time back. And if I
          describe it as &#8220;decrease our build time&#8221; instead, everyone
          can understand the value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lasly, I want to slow down our ticket lifecycle a bit. That&#8217;s
          not to say that I want to do less work, I just want to increase value
          and collaboration of our work. Rather than trying to
          &#8220;quickly&#8221; put in a new feature, I want to ensure
          it&#8217;s properly planned, designed and understood. We should know
          how we&#8217;ll test it, understand the value and the risks. That
          means more time thinking up-front, and more pushing back in
          refinement/planning sessions.
        </p>
