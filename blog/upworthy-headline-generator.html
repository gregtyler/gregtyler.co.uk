  Recently I&#39;ve been getting a lot of people posting links to
  <a href="https://www.upworthy.com/">Upworthy</a> articles on Facebook.
  I realised their headlines often followed a similar style so decided
  to make a little application to generate them.

<p>You can check out the generator at the link below:</p>

  A quick technical note: The code that pulls out random terms is
  weighted in this (which is why some people and events show up more or
  less regularly than others). To do this, every term is an object with
  a label and a weight. I take the sum of all the weights then generate
  a random number, <code>rand</code>, between 0 and that. The code then
  iterates through the array of objects and subtracts the weight of each
  one from the <code>rand</code>. When <code>rand</code> falls below 0,
  we&#39;re at the object we want.
</p>

  I actually had the code for this sitting around already for another
  project I&#39;m working on, which was timely.
