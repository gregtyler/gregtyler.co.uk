  I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/">Sporcle</a>.
  It&#8217;s a quiz website which is entirely user-submitted, meaning
  there&#8217;s a really wide array of quizzes on a variety of subjects.
  Subjects like
  <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/gb271/goalsforcfc?t=soccer"
    >Fernando Torres&#8217;s 2010/11 goal record</a
  >
  or
  <a
    href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/gwukelic/i_dont_think_george_washington_is_going_to_make_it_on_this_quiz?t=politics"
    >US President birth states</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Part of my love of Sporcle is its simplicity. It harkens back to the
  early internet: where sites were run for love and not profit, where
  users provided data because they <em>wanted</em> to, where creating an
  account was an option rather than a requirement.
</p>

<p>
  That Web 1.0 simplicity aludes to the fact that Sporcle is totally
  independent. Unlike many of the big websites , it&#8217;s not a
  subsidiary of Amazon or Google, it&#8217;s not owned by some umbrella
  corporation. Parent company Sporcle Inc. has three offices,
  <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/triviacon/">a conference</a> and
  <a href="https://www.haymakerpublichouse.com/">a bar</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m not sure what Sporcle&#8217;s profitability model looks like
  (I assume it&#8217;s mostly ad-based) and maybe that&#8217;s dissuaded
  potential buyers. But, like many recent acquisitions, I think its real
  value is the data.
</p>

<h2>Feeding the beast</h2>

<p>
  As mentioned earlier, Sporcle&#8217;s quizzes are all written by
  users. Some of these are spur of the moment or strangely specific,
  others are generic, popular and well-maintained.
</p>

<p>
  Take, for example, the quizzes to name
  <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/disneyanimatedmovies"
    >every Disney movie</a
  >
  or
  <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/presidents"
    >every president</a
  >. Both of these quizzes ultimately contain structured and maintained
  data which is useful for many data-driven companies. Voice assistant
  questions like &#8220;when was Aladdin released&#8221; and &#8220;who
  was President in 1932&#8221; are answerable on tap.
</p>

<p>
  Users are readily submitting and maintaining this information for
  others&#8217; enjoyment, and that value could be multiplied by a savvy
  tech company (at a very real reputational risk).
</p>

<h2>Beasting the feed</h2>

<p>
  Using user-submitted data for new purposes is cool, but I&#8217;m more
  interested in the inverse. Voice assistants can already answer those
  questions today, the data is already available, so can we reverse the
  process to turn that <em>into</em> a quiz?
</p>

<p>
  At its simplest level, this could be taking
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Categories"
    >Wikipedia categories</a
  >
  and turning them into simple how-many-can-you-name quizzes. For that
  specific purpose, I&#8217;m pleased to announce
  <a href="https://spork-hell.glitch.me/"><strong>Spork Hell</strong></a
  >, my first attempt at generative quizzing.
</p>

<p>
  Spork Hell finds a Wikipedia category at random (<em>completely</em>
  at random, which can produce interesting results) and asks you how
  many member pages you can list.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image">
  <img
    src="/images/imagen-625x326.png"
    alt='Quiz asking players to name "County seats in California". There are 58 possible answers, but only three have been identified so far.'
    class="wp-image-1507"
    srcset="
      /images/imagen-625x326.png 625w,
      /images/imagen-300x156.png 300w,
      /images/imagen.png         746w
    "
    sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"
  />
</figure>

<p>
  Spork Hell is random, variously interesting and consistently hard. I
  think it perfectly captures the amazing possibilities and serious
  challenges of generative quizzing.
</p>

<p>
  <em
    >I also made
    <a href="https://spork-hell-lists.glitch.me/"
      >a version of Spork Hell</a
    >
    which uses Wikipedia&#8217;s &#8220;List of&#8230;&#8221; pages
    which is even more random and way more challenging to implement.</em

</p>

<h2>Structured data</h2>

<p>
  So far I&#8217;ve only looked at &#8220;flat&#8221; data: I take a
  list of items and just replay them back to the user. I&#8217;d like to
  take this further and generate quizzes from structured data, which
  would allow much more complex quizzes and massively swell the number
  of possibilities.
</p>

<p>
  As a basic example: imagine I have some basic information on
  countries, cities and which country each city is in. Some quizzes I
  could extract are (square brackets represent variables):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name the capital cities of the world</li>
  <li>Name the capital cities within [100 miles] of [London]</li>
  <li>List the largest cities in [Poland] in order</li>
  <li>Name the capital cities with less than [60,000] population</li>
  <li>Name the countries with at least one megacity</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Not only could I manually extract these quizzes, but I think I could
  reasonably expect a computer program to do so for me just by looking
  at the data available.
</p>

<p>
  New data would then lead to many more possibilities: adding language
  information could make quizzes like &#8220;Name the most populous
  [German] speaking countries&#8221;; economic information could give us
  &#8220;Name the biggest exporters of [bananas]&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
  And all of this can be further subdivided into more specific quizzes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name the biggest [TV] exporting countries in [Western Europe]</li>
  <li>
    Name the [French] speaking capital cities within [1000 miles] of
    [Paris]
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Finally, I&#8217;d hope that a computer program would continue to
  generate the weird stuff.

  Hopefully this is the first in a series of posts of playing with
  generative quizzing, but for now please enjoy my early, extremely
  challenging attempts:
