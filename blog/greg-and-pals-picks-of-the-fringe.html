  Ah, the
  <a href="https://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a> is
  back! As a resident of the city, the Fringe brings equal parts joy of
  all the shows you can see and pain of all the tourists suddenly
  filling the streets. I like to think I&#39;m more on the
  &quot;joy&quot; bandwagon, but give it four weeks and we&#39;ll see if
  I&#39;m still feeling it.
</p>
<p>
  Anyhow, every year lots of great magazines and websites set out to
  review as much as possible. They do a really good job, but I like
  getting advice from friends rather than strangers. So this Fringe
  I&#39;m asking some of my mates to list the shows they&#39;d recommend
  and tell us why! Below you can find some of the top shows of the
  Edinburgh Fringe, as recommended by <strong>Greg and Pals</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  I&#39;ll be updating this as often as I can, so check back in through
  the month.

  <em>Underbelly, Bristo Square</em><br />I&#39;ve never had to try so
  hard not to just openly cry in laughter/happiness/sadness.

  <em>Pleasance Courtyard</em><br />Satirical comedy play. Not
  hysterical, but full of a lot of funny stuff.

  <em>theSpace @ Venue 45</em><br />I only got a ticket for this via a
  friend who booked it by accident, but it turned out to be a really
  slick, clever play. The production was really well put together, with
  wonderful performances from the cast, excellent lighting and some
  fantastic music (I love electroswing).

  <em>Underbelly, Cowgate</em><br />Physically, it&#39;s a dude sitting
  in a chair for an hour. But if you enjoy well-performed monologues,
  this is well worth seeing.

<p>
  <em>Underbelly, Bristo Square, Weekend evenings</em><br />I&#39;m
  totally biased about this event, because it took place in the room
  where I graduated, and I will take up any opportunity to party in
  there in a heartbeat. HDTM plays songs chronologically from 1954 to
  2013, which sounds awesome, and in my opinion totally lives up to that
  expectation.

<p>
  As far as I&#39;m concerned, Matthew is a Fringe expert. He always
  seems to know what the best comedy shows around are. I reckon he&#39;s
  secretly on the circuit, so has checked out all these acts in advance.
  Whilst this would sort of be cheating, I&#39;ll let it slide since
  I&#39;ve got no real evidence to prove it.

  <em>Assembly Roxy</em><br />Comedy theatre by two outstanding
  performers who interweave ridiculous characters and outlandish mime in
  a mesmerising and achingly hilarious hour.

  <em>Pleasance Courtyard</em><br />Best sketch comedy I&#39;ve seen
  &#8211; fantastic delivery with beautifully linked recurring jokes,
  could not stop laughing from the off.

<p>
  <em>Pleasance Courtyard</em><br />A 20-something bisexual comic with
  an erratic sense of humour. A definite 5/5 for this young guy,
  he&#39;s got it nailed on he head. Great audience involvement. If
  you&#39;re going to see it in 2013, take a fan with you &#8211; the
  venue is roasty toasty!
