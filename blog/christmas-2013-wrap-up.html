summary: After finishing my Christmas film adventures, I note some conclusions and statistics about the 19 hours of films watched over the past month.

<p>
  For the month of December up to Christmas, I busied myself watching a
  selection of festive films. Ranging from the classics (<a
    href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-muppet-christmas-carol/"
    >The Muppet Christmas Carol</a
  >) to the strange (<a
    href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/holiday-in-handcuffs/"
    >Holiday in Handcuffs</a
  >), straddling some disappointingly non-Christmassy flicks along the
  way (<a
    href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/on-her-majestys-secret-service/"
    >On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</a
  >), I enjoyed the whole experience.
</p>
<p>
  You can find the full list of films watched, with my star-rating and a
  link to each review

    >right here</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  After all this joy, I thought it would be suitable to write a
  follow-up post looking back at some statistics.
</p>
<p>
  I watched <strong>12 films</strong> with an average length of
  <strong>1 hour, 38 minutes</strong> which means I watched a total of
  <strong>19 hours and 39 minutes</strong> of Christmas movies. The
  longest was
  <em
    >On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service_, weighing in at over two
    hours. The shortest was _The Muppet Christmas Carol</em
  >
  which wraps itself up in 1 hour, 28 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  If I was paid minimum wage to watch each film, I would&#39;ve earned
  Â£124 which would buy me <strong>310 litres of milk</strong>, which is
  enough to fill a couple of bathtubs! I could be <em>bathing</em> in
  milk.
</p>
<h2 id="notable-mentions">Notable mentions</h2>
<p>
  There were lots of films I didn&#39;t get to watch, and several I
  chose not to. Top of the list of recommendations were
  <em>Die Hard</em> and
  <em
    >Love Actually_, two films that I love far too much to fairly
    review. A few older films were also recommended to me that I
    didn&#39;t get to watch, including _The Bishop&#39;s Wife</em
  >
  and <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Lest we forget, too, the weirder films that I didn&#39;t get around
  to. We had planned to watch <em>Reindeer Games</em> in which Ben
  Affleck becomes &quot;the unwilling mastermind of a Christmas Eve
  casino heist&quot;. I&#39;ll definitely be watching that piece of joy
  sometime soon. I missed _Make the Yuletide Gay_, in which a gay
  college student has trouble coming out to his parents at Christmas;
  _Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman_, the horror
  sequel that never needed to happen, and _Jack Frost (1998)_, where a
  son reconnects with his dead father who reappears as a snowman and
  slowly, tragically melts. Frankly, I made efforts to avoid all three.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, there are
  <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_relating_to_Christmas"
    >a lot of Christmas films</a
  >. It was hard to pick which ones to watch and the decision was often
  made from convenience of what people had on DVD. I&#39;m sorry if I
  missed your favourite film, but maybe I&#39;ll get round to some more
  next year.
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1425922/">Black Nativity</a> is
  out on DVD now, and to not review that would be sacrilege.

  Here&#39;s an interesting grid of some common themes across the
  movies, and which ones hit the mark:

</p>
<p>
  You&#39;ll notice that, according to this rudimentary system, the most
  Christmassy film was
  <em
    >The Santa Clause_, scoring in all categories. Scoring no points
    were _Shaft</em
  >
  and <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> (which should come as
  no surprise), but also <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> which is a bit of
  a shame as it at least tries to be festive.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  I <em>did</em> enjoy watching all these films, despite my general
  dislike for Christmas. A lot of them were really nice, caring films
  that help you to get in that all important festive spirit. I saw quite
  a few with friends, and it was great to hang out with them, centring
  an evening around watching a movie and using this blog as an excuse to
  chill.
</p>
<p>
  Picking a favourite film from the selection would be like picking a
  favourite child, and mine would be <em>The Santa Clause</em>. It
  embodies the Christmas spirit, and manages to keep its humour whilst
  focussed around serious issues of divorce and broken families. My
  least favourite was <em>Home Alone: The Holiday Heist</em> whose only
  redeeming feature was the appearance of Malcolm McDowell.
