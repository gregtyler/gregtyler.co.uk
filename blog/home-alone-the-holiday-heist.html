summary: In my Christmas films season, we find the first clanger. The fifth Home Alone film fails to provide anything of quality whatsoever.

  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Finn Baxter, our latest child hero, is left alone because
  he&#39;d rather play a video game that go with his parents to an
  office Christmas party. His horrible obsession with this game forms
  the _entire plot of the film_, at one point using a search for
  controller batteries to lead him to a secret room. Meanwhile, at the
  party, all the waitresses are young girls dressed in short red dresses
  and red-and-white-striped stockings. These antitheses of Christmas
  spirit could be used to poke fun at the modern world, but instead
  they&#39;re just played straight and it&#39;s really weird.
</p>
<p>
  There is a heartfelt moment when Finn talks to a college student
  he&#39;s playing his video game with and finds out the guy is going to
  spend Christmas alone. Finn seems horrified for a short while and
  offers to keep the guy company, which is quite sweet, but then he gets
  caught up on ghosts again.

    No, BBC Breakfast fans, not _that_ Bill Turnbull.

  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Not Macaulay Culkin, that&#39;s for sure! (Though he
  <em>is</em> 33 now, so that would be a very different movie.) Indeed,
  also no Joe Pesci and no Daniel Stern. 22 years after the first Home
  Alone, <em>Holiday Heist</em> shares little with the original, save
  name and concept.
</p>
<p>
  However, getting a star in this category is Malcolm McDowell, taking
  the role of criminal boss. McDowell, who deserves to be in much, much
  better content than this, does a great job of being an affable thief
  and generally delivers his lines wonderfully. Incidentally, if you
  never watched _Heroes_, he excels as Linderman (another criminal
  mastermind).
</p>
<p>
  Another honourable mention is due to Bill Turnbull, who plays
  Finn&#39;s video gaming college friend and got the only two laughs of
  the film. We like him.

  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ Eurgh. Whilst I wouldn&#39;t recommend the damn thing to
  anyone, I guess it should score some points in the family fun
  category. Like the previous films, the slapstick comedy is pretty
  family friendly and harmless (in a manner of speaking). And, again as
  before, the criminals are extremely non-threatening, useless goons.
  But if that&#39;s the sort of family fun you&#39;re looking for, just
  watch the original.

  ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ There are some carol singers ( 1) and McFly&#39;s cover of
  Deck the Halls (-1). Yeah, don&#39;t bother watching this for the
  music.

  Finn Baxter&#39;s page on the
  <a href="http://homealone.wikia.com/wiki/Finn_Baxter"
    >Home Alone Wiki</a
  >
  has a section labelled &quot;Personality&quot; which is just blank.
  That is incredibly accurate.
