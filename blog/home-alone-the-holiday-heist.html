          ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Finn Baxter, our latest child hero, is left alone because
          he&#39;d rather play a video game that go with his parents to an
          office Christmas party. His horrible obsession with this game forms
          the _entire plot of the film_, at one point using a search for
          controller batteries to lead him to a secret room. Meanwhile, at the
          party, all the waitresses are young girls dressed in short red dresses
          and red-and-white-striped stockings. These antitheses of Christmas
          spirit could be used to poke fun at the modern world, but instead
          they&#39;re just played straight and it&#39;s really weird.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a heartfelt moment when Finn talks to a college student
          he&#39;s playing his video game with and finds out the guy is going to
          spend Christmas alone. Finn seems horrified for a short while and
          offers to keep the guy company, which is quite sweet, but then he gets
          caught up on ghosts again.

            No, BBC Breakfast fans, not _that_ Bill Turnbull.

          ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Not Macaulay Culkin, that&#39;s for sure! (Though he
          <em>is</em> 33 now, so that would be a very different movie.) Indeed,
          also no Joe Pesci and no Daniel Stern. 22 years after the first Home
          Alone, <em>Holiday Heist</em> shares little with the original, save
          name and concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, getting a star in this category is Malcolm McDowell, taking
          the role of criminal boss. McDowell, who deserves to be in much, much
          better content than this, does a great job of being an affable thief
          and generally delivers his lines wonderfully. Incidentally, if you
          never watched _Heroes_, he excels as Linderman (another criminal
          mastermind).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another honourable mention is due to Bill Turnbull, who plays
          Finn&#39;s video gaming college friend and got the only two laughs of
          the film. We like him.

        <p>
          ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ Eurgh. Whilst I wouldn&#39;t recommend the damn thing to
          anyone, I guess it should score some points in the family fun
          category. Like the previous films, the slapstick comedy is pretty
          family friendly and harmless (in a manner of speaking). And, again as
          before, the criminals are extremely non-threatening, useless goons.
          But if that&#39;s the sort of family fun you&#39;re looking for, just
          watch the original.

          ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ There are some carol singers ( 1) and McFly&#39;s cover of
          Deck the Halls (-1). Yeah, don&#39;t bother watching this for the
          music.
