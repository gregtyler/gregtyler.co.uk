<p>
  For the past few years (<a href="/personal/2015-year-in-review"
    >2015</a
  >, <a href="/personal/2014-year-in-review">2014</a>,
  <a href="/personal/2013-year-in-review">2013</a>), I finished each
  December with a &quot;Year in Review&quot;: an categorised list of the
  things I&#39;ve done in the year, what I&#39;ve enjoyed, and what
  I&#39;ve seen. 2015 was, I concluded, &quot;completely rad&quot;. 2014
  was &quot;a perfectly pleasant year&quot;. 2013, most introspectively,
  was &quot;a year of development&quot;. This year I&#39;ve run out of
  platitudes.
</p>
<p>
  So I want to do this year&#39;s post a bit differently. I&#39;m going
  to focus on the good things first. Then I&#39;ll take a look at some
  of the bad world events. Finally I&#39;ll take a look at my
  resolutions from last year, and set some new goals for 2017. I&#39;ll
  split up each section so you can read the bits that interest you.

<p>
  Work was very positive and kind of unusual. I&#39;m continuing to work
  at the University, with the exciting new job title of
  &quot;Analyst/Developer&quot;. With that title has come some workload
  change, and I&#39;ve spent much longer trying to figure out data
  strategy rather than actually building things.
</p>
<p>
  More specifically, I&#39;ve spent most of the year working on our
  <a
    href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/student-systems/support-guidance/admin-support-staff/student-admin-colleges-schools/assessment-and-progression"
    >Assessment and Progression tools</a
  >
  project. This sprawling multi-year project has easily enough work to
  keep five of us busy full-time, and plenty more besides. Its duration
  and scope have given us a great opportunity to experiment with project
  management too, which has been an inimitable learning experience.
</p>
<p>
  Away from my day-to-day work, other jobs and side projects have been
  going well. I&#39;m still hosting at the Dagda Quiz, with a growing
  crowd, and still doing little projects both for extra pocket money and
  for fun. Rebuilding <a href="/">this very website</a> in Node was
  fascinating, and I need to blog about it. More widely, I&#39;ve loved
  experimenting more with JavaScript both server- and client-side.
  I&#39;ve enjoyed working with
  <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and, most recently,
  <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte</a>.

  2016 was a great year for travel. I finally visited the magical city
  of Venice, and was strangely fortunate to witness it flood. As well as
  beautiful architecture and incredible views, Venice offered up
  wonderful food and drink and provided an excellent destination for a
  long weekend.
</p>
<p>
  I went to the USA for the first time, visiting Utah, Arizona and Las
  Vegas. I feel really lucky to have managed to see so many different
  experiences in that one trip: we toured Mormon temples, visited
  national parks, saw cave paintings, drove through the Wild West and
  lost some money in the world&#39;s best known casinos. It&#39;s a trip
  I&#39;ll never forget.

/><br/>
  In August, I went with a friend on a long weekend to Denmark and
  Sweden, primarily to watch one of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii">Avicii&#39;s</a> last
  live shows. The show was great, and I was absolutely taken with what I
  saw of Scandinavia too. Copenhagen particularly is a beautiful city.
</p>
<p>
  In the summer, I took part in the regular family pilgrimage to
  Shetland. Shetland is a lovely place, and a wonderful location to get
  away from it all. I also visited London, Chelmsford, Whitby, Arran,
  Peebles, Bristol, Oxford, The Cairngorms, Yorkshire, York (twice) and
  Sheffield to continue my goals of visiting more of my own country.
</p>
<p>
  This was also the year that I started using Instagram, which might
  seem like an odd thing to highlight in this post, but it really tied
  in well to my travelling. I started using it because I wanted to take
  better photographs, and to document the things that I&#39;ve been
  doing over the year. Looking back now,
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsgregtyler/">my account</a> has a
  wonderful collection of pictures from around the UK and the world and
  I&#39;m thrilled to be able to reminisce with them.

<p>
  Despite the travelling, and development at work, 2016 is not a year I
  can look back at fondly. It&#39;s a year in which my European identity
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results"
    >was taken away from me</a
  >; in which an elected official was
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36550304"
    >murdered for her political views</a
  >; in which hate crimes rose in the

  having run a campaign of bullying, lying and misogyny on an
  unprecedented scale.
</p>
<p>
  2016 seemed like the culmination of a lot of things that have been
  brewing for years. EU resentment, worry for financial security in an
  increasing world population, and traditional racism together found a
  cause to get behind in Brexit. Similar intersectionality in the US
  gave way to Trump&#39;s election as anti-establishment movements,
  disenfranchised voters and sexists all found an individual campaign to
  get behind. And as we look on now, it&#39;s hard not to blur the lines
  between those groups. To all of our detriment.
</p>
<p>
  Looking back over the year&#39;s events–particularly Brexit, the US
  election and Russian activities–it&#39;s been hard to put together a
  singular identification of quite what&#39;s going wrong. The media are
  involved, as is the rise of fascism in parts of America and Europe,
  and our modern news portals like Facebook and Twitter have a hand too.
  But there doesn&#39;t seem to be a unifying thing and I find that a
  bit terrifying.
</p>
<p>
  To me, a huge problem has been people voting selfishly. In all recent
  political engagements, on both sides, voters regularly identify (both
  in public quotes and personal conversations) as voting for the option
  that provides them with the most financial or influential gain. Trump
  voters are able to look over his misgivings and mistakes because they
  believe that, as a businessman, he will help them earn and hold onto
  their money. Brexit voters almost without exception quoted EU
  membership costs (paid from taxes) as a reason for their support.
</p>
<p>
  There is, of course, an argument that Trump <em>won&#39;t</em> help
  others get rich and that leaving the EU will cost <em>more</em> than
  membership fees. But my concern is with the number of people voting
  purely for themselves and not thinking of what&#39;s best for everyone
  else. In simplest terms, if everyone voted for themselves and the
  majority always won then we would not have seen an end to slavery,
  there would be no LGBT rights and UK women would just about be
  clinging on to suffrage.
</p>
<p>
  On a more realistic level, it&#39;s phrases like &quot;why should I
  pay for others to use the NHS when I don&#39;t need it myself?&quot;
  that worry me. Recently I saw a discussion about whether voters should
  have a say on how much of their tax is spent on foreign aid. Whilst
  others seem to find <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> being funded by
  their TV license the greatest affront of the year.
</p>
<p>
  This constant &quot;what&#39;s in it for me?&quot; attitude, and lack
  of sight beyond one&#39;s own bubble, are at risk of dismantling the
  work of socialism that has taken so long to achieve. And that damage
  falls only onto the bottom of society, as the alternative is a world
  designed for those with money to continue getting it and leave the
  rest behind.
</p>
<p>
  These programmes–the NHS, the welfare state, social security, equal
  rights, the EU–took years to form and could be undone in an instant.
  If we don&#39;t support them, they will be lost. Not (just) by
  politicians who seek to profit from their demise, but from our own
  citizens who don&#39;t see the benefit of the programme, don&#39;t
  emphasise with its beneficiaries, and don&#39;t see themselves in a
  role of supporting others.
</p>
<p>
  That&#39;s why 2016 has sucked so much for me: we are marching ever
  further down a dangerous path in which we lose some of our
  country&#39;s best work.

  Resolutions and looking forward
</h2>
<p>
  Last year, for the first time in many years, I wrote some
  <a href="/personal/resolutions-for-2016">resolutions for myself</a>.
  Let&#39;s see how I got on.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Write 20 blog posts or articles of at least 1000 words.</strong
    >
    I wrote 16 articles last year across three different blogs, and
    I&#39;m pretty happy with that. I think, in retrospect, the target
    number was too high.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Watch 10 silent films.</strong> I didn&#39;t do this, so
    I&#39;m pushing it forward to 2017.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Record at least one podcast episode.</strong> Nor this. Also
    for 2017.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Play 24 hours of badminton.</strong> Whilst I didn&#39;t
    achieve this, I <em>did</em> join a gym and start going regularly.
    Considering the reason for wanting to play badminton was for
    fitness, I think I can consider this achieved.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Despite considering some resolutions achieved when I didn&#39;t
  actually meet the success criteria, I want to continue this year to
  set specific measurable targets for 2017. It gives me something to aim
  for, to track progress with, and to look back at.
</p>
<h3 id="1-write-12-blog-posts-or-articles-of-at-least-1000-words">
  1. Write 12 blog posts or articles of at least 1000 words
</h3>
<p>
  It&#39;s back! 12 articles this year because it&#39;s more attainable,
  and works out at one-per-month.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/ssl-read-errno-10054/">SSL 10054</a> is still my most
  popular article by far. And user retention has gone up since switching
  from WordPress to custom Node.js, even though features like
  &quot;recommended articles&quot; and search are now missing.
</p>
<h3 id="2-record-at-least-one-podcast-episode">
  2. Record at least one podcast episode
</h3>
<p>
  Also back. In the past year, I&#39;ve sketched out some more ideas of
  what I want to do and been fascinated that the idea I have hasn&#39;t
  been done by someone else yet. I want to get this one done early.
</p>
<h3 id="3-release-five-games">3. Release five games</h3>
<p>
  There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, I like making games
  and game design. I really enjoy the challenge of making something fun
  and balanced, if only for five minutes. Secondly, making browser-based
  games is a great opportunity to try new libraries and frameworks.
  It&#39;s helped me experiment with
  <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and
  <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte</a>, and I hope this year
  to use this to play with
  <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> and maybe
  <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="4-watch-10-silent-movies">4. Watch 10 silent movies</h3>
<p>
  I&#39;m not sure this is important in and of itself, but I want to do
  it because I failed to last year and I don&#39;t like losing. Even to
  myself.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  I also want to make a few non-measurable general goals for 2017. These
  are things I don&#39;t really have a way of tracking, that I just want
  to try work into my general attitude for the year.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Identify as more than a web developer.</strong> I don&#39;t
    like introducing myself when meeting people as &quot;a university
    web developer&quot;. I want to do much more than that. So, by the
    end of the year, I want to be able to rattle off a few things I do
    rather than just one.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Take better photographs.</strong> Photos have meant a lot to
    me this year, and will continue to do so when I look back at them. I
    want to ensure they are of the highest quality.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Educate more.</strong> I know a lot about technology and
    security that I could pass on to family and friends. I want to help
    them have a safe, secure and happy time on the web. I also want to
    talk more about my political views rather than descending into
    baseless arguments.
  </li>
</ol>
