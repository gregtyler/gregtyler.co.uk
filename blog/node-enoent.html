title: Node.js ENOENT error explanations

summary: I came across an ENOENT error in Node, which was hard to decipher. Because explanations and advice across the Internet and sparsely laid out, I tried to compile all the reasons in one place. Includes fixes and example code to regenerate each scenario.
---
<p>
  Recently when using the <code>saveScreenshot</code> function of
  WebdriverIO, I came across the following Node error:
</p>
<pre><code>ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '{filepath}'</code></pre>
<p>
  There are a lot of reasons this error could occur, all of which I
  looked at when trying to solve the problem. Because they are widely
  spread across the internet, and I couldn&#39;t find anyone addressing
  the problem I actually had, I thought I would enumerate them here.
</p>
<p>
  I&#39;ve also given some
  <a href="https://github.com/gregtyler/enoent">example code</a> for you
  to look at and play with. Reproducing the errors may help you figure
  out what causes them.

  1. You&#39;re trying to read a file that doesn&#39;t exist
</h2>
<p>
  As the error message suggests, the file you&#39;re trying to read
  isn&#39;t there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>To fix:</strong> Use the first parameter of the (e.g.
  <code>readFile</code>) function to catch the error. Perhaps use
  <code>fs.stat</code> or <code>fs.access</code> to check for access
  first.

>
  2. You&#39;re trying to create a file in a <em>directory</em> that
  doesn&#39;t exist
</h2>
<p>
  Node won&#39;t create your intermediary directories. So if you try to
  create a file <code>logs/pushout.log</code> and
  <code>logs</code> directory doesn&#39;t exist, you&#39;ll see this
  error.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>To fix:</strong> Create the <code>logs</code> directory first
  with <code>fs.mkdir</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="3-you-re-using-a-relative-path-incorrectly">
  3. You&#39;re using a relative path incorrectly
</h2>
<p>
  This often is related to Issue 2, but without the developer&#39;s
  knowledge. Paths specified in <code>fs</code> functions are relative
  to the _currently executing script location_, not the file where the
  code is called from. So if <code>index.js</code> calls
  <code>processes/makeLogFile.js</code>, then the path used is relative
  to <code>index.js</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>To fix:</strong> Either use <code>__dirname</code> to get the
  path that the code is being written in, and add to that, or add
  subdirectories as necessary.
</p>
<h2 id="4-you-re-trying-to-create-a-file-that-can-t-exist">
  4. You&#39;re trying to create a file that <em>can&#39;t</em> exist
</h2>
<p>
  This was my problem. I had the following, fairly self-explanatory
  code:
</p>
<pre><code>driver.save<span class="hljs-constructor">Screenshot('.<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-params">screens</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-params">error</span>-'   (<span class="hljs-params">new</span> Date()</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span><span class="hljs-constructor">ISOString()</span>   '.png');</code></pre>
<p>
  This was supposed to create a unique screenshot in the
  <code>screens</code> directory but I got the ENOENT error instead.
</p>
<p>
  What I didn&#39;t account for is that
  <code>toISOString()</code> creates a time format with colons in it,
  and Windows will not allow colons in file names. So the error
  wasn&#39;t really saying that the file <em>doesn&#39;t</em> exist, but
  that it simply <em>couldn&#39;t</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>To fix:</strong> My fix was just using
  <code>replace(/:/g, &#39;-&#39;)</code> to turn all the colons into
  hyphens. But, generally, fix this by making sure there are no
  disallowed characters in the file name.
</p>

  I hope these explanations help you. If you&#39;ve got any questions,
  corrections or additions, please
