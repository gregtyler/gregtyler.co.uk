        <p>
          I can&#39;t remember the last time I wrote any New Year&#39;s
          resolutions. I must&#39;ve done so when I was a kid, but I really
          can&#39;t remember any. Anyhow, I&#39;ve decided to write some this
          year to help me keep on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of New Year&#39;s resolutions are too vague. Things like
          &quot;Get fit&quot;, &quot;Spend less time on Facebook&quot;, &quot;Be
          nicer to Mike&quot;. Whilst we can all get on board with the sentiment
          behind them (poor Mike has had a rough year), they&#39;re not very
          easy to achieve because they&#39;re not measurable. I&#39;ve learnt
          from work that if you don&#39;t have a strategy for measuring the
          success of a project it&#39;s barely worth doing it, so I&#39;m
          determined to make my resolutions measurable and attainable.

          <li>Win the war on terrorism.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>JK. Edgy.</p>
        <p>
          But focussing on measurable goals does come at the cost that my
          resolutions don&#39;t really sum up my intentions for the year.
          Obviously I want to be healthier, more sociable and nicer—and these
          resolutions should help be get there—but that personal development is
          the sum total of all the little things I do.

          Either on this site, or on
          <a href="https://medium.com/@gregtyler">my Medium profile</a>. Writing
          is therapeutic and helps you think in a different, analytical way. I
          don&#39;t want to write to be read (my

          so far has been read by one person), but for my own self-development.
          Hopefully if I write enough then my style and content will improve and
          people will want to read it, but this is for me.

        <p>
          Surprisingly, I came up with this in Nicaragua whilst in a bar playing
          Harold Lloyd&#39;s
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Heaven's_Sake_(1926_film)"
            >For Heaven&#39;s Sake</a
          >. It&#39;s not Lloyd&#39;s best but it&#39;s still an excellent film
          with that enduring charm that only really exists in silent movies. I
          used to love silent films, but haven&#39;t watched many recently. In
          2016 I want to watch a bunch to remind myself how much I enjoy them.
          This is also a great opportunity to share the films with other people
          and introduce them to the silent world.

        <p>
          I have an idea for a podcast that I&#39;m keeping under wraps at the
          moment. I&#39;ve talked for years about recording a podcast and this
          particular idea really seems to me to have legs. This resolution will
          hopefully force my hand a bit and get me to give the idea a fair
          crack.

        <p>Not in one sitting, hopefully.</p>
        <p>
          I played a fair amount of badminton in the start of 2015, but fell
          away from it later in the year. It&#39;s a good sport and I don&#39;t
          get enough exercise, so this should get me going!
