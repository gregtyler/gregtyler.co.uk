<p>
  I can&#39;t remember the last time I wrote any New Year&#39;s
  resolutions. I must&#39;ve done so when I was a kid, but I really
  can&#39;t remember any. Anyhow, I&#39;ve decided to write some this
  year to help me keep on track.
</p>
<p>
  A lot of New Year&#39;s resolutions are too vague. Things like
  &quot;Get fit&quot;, &quot;Spend less time on Facebook&quot;, &quot;Be
  nicer to Mike&quot;. Whilst we can all get on board with the sentiment
  behind them (poor Mike has had a rough year), they&#39;re not very
  easy to achieve because they&#39;re not measurable. I&#39;ve learnt
  from work that if you don&#39;t have a strategy for measuring the
  success of a project it&#39;s barely worth doing it, so I&#39;m
  determined to make my resolutions measurable and attainable.
</p>
<p>
  But focussing on measurable goals does come at the cost that my
  resolutions don&#39;t really sum up my intentions for the year.
  Obviously I want to be healthier, more sociable and nicer—and these
  resolutions should help be get there—but that personal development is
  the sum total of all the little things I do.

<h2 id="1-write-20-blog-posts-or-articles-of-at-least-1000-words">
  1. Write 20 blog posts or articles of at least 1000 words
</h2>
<p>
  Either on this site, or on
  <a href="https://medium.com/@gregtyler">my Medium profile</a>. Writing
  is therapeutic and helps you think in a different, analytical way. I
  don&#39;t want to write to be read (my
  <a

    >latest Medium post</a

  so far has been read by one person), but for my own self-development.
  Hopefully if I write enough then my style and content will improve and
  people will want to read it, but this is for me.

  Incidentally, 25% of traffic to this site has been to
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/ssl-read-errno-10054/"
    >1 article</a

  Google and DuckDuckGo; first on Bing. It&#39;s good to have a niche.

<h2 id="2-watch-10-silent-films">2. Watch 10 silent films</h2>
<p>
  Surprisingly, I came up with this in Nicaragua whilst in a bar playing
  Harold Lloyd&#39;s
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Heaven's_Sake_(1926_film)"
    >For Heaven&#39;s Sake</a
  >. It&#39;s not Lloyd&#39;s best but it&#39;s still an excellent film
  with that enduring charm that only really exists in silent movies. I
  used to love silent films, but haven&#39;t watched many recently. In
  2016 I want to watch a bunch to remind myself how much I enjoy them.
  This is also a great opportunity to share the films with other people
  and introduce them to the silent world.

  3. Record at least one podcast episode
</h2>
<p>
  I have an idea for a podcast that I&#39;m keeping under wraps at the
  moment. I&#39;ve talked for years about recording a podcast and this
  particular idea really seems to me to have legs. This resolution will
  hopefully force my hand a bit and get me to give the idea a fair
  crack.

<p>Not in one sitting, hopefully.</p>
<p>
  I played a fair amount of badminton in the start of 2015, but fell
  away from it later in the year. It&#39;s a good sport and I don&#39;t
  get enough exercise, so this should get me going!
