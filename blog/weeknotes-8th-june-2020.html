        <p>This week I started to take ownership of my code.</p>

        <p>
          In last week&#8217;s weeknotes, I talked about the stress I felt under
          of being partially responsible fora lot of old, untouched code.
        </p>

        <p>
          With reassurance that I can own that code, I&#8217;ve started to take
          control of things a bit more. I had a task to edit an aging and
          oddly-designed API, and took the opportunity to clean it up and plan
          for the future a little more.
        </p>

        <p>
          There&#8217;s a lot to untangle here and it&#8217;ll take time, but
          these baby steps will make a start and also help me feel more
          comfortable with the code base.
        </p>

        <p>
          We&#8217;ve also started talking seriously about how to split up the
          code between the two entangled services, which is another huge task.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some things can just be split apart, but for the rest we&#8217;re
          probably going to duplicate all of the code and let each service
          remove the parts they don&#8217;t need. This puts a bit more pressure
          on each service, but gives us autonomy and independence to make
          improvements aligned with our separate service goals.
