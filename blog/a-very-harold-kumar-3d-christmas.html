  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ I&#39;m guessing this is one of the ones I&#39;m going to
  have arguments about.
</p>
<p>
  Something I often consider in this category of how central a role
  Christmas plays in the plot and narrative. Inarguably, in _3D
  Christmas_, the festive season is key to everything that&#39;s going
  on. The plot centres around the acquisition of a suitable Christmas
  tree, and the timeframe is set by the family being out at midnight
  mass. Christmas parties, gifts and Santa then play a central role.
</p>
<p>
  The message of the film is set through Harold&#39;s development, as he
  realises that the important thing about Christmas is to be with family
  and friends, to forgive others and yourself; and how sweating the
  details is a needless distraction in this goal. In the end all the
  characters have a great Christmas, despite all they&#39;ve been
  through, because they&#39;re all together. That, to my mind, is what
  Christmas is all about.
</p>
<p>However, I see pot more as a summer drug.</p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ John Cho and Kal Penn have been through a lot since their
  original drug-infused trip to
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Whitecastle</a>. Cho
  has done the acting rounds, featuring as Sulu in the 2009 Star Trek
  rebirth and its sequel (as well as featuring across scores of films
  and television series). Meanwhile Penn, having spent two season on
  _House_, has taken up the position of Associate Director at the White
  House Office of Public Engagement. As such, it&#39;s really impressive
  to see them both reprise such irreverent roles.
</p>
<p>
  There are some strong references to the development of the past years
  from Adrian (CollegeHumor&#39;s Amir Blumenfeld) who remarks of Harold
  &quot;Can we drop this tree off at Sulu&#39;s and head to the
  city?&quot; and explains to Kumar that &quot;I told her you work for
  the White House&quot;, with the Associate Director responding
  &quot;Yeah, like anyone&#39;s gonna believe that.&quot;

<p>
  We also see a return of Neil Patrick Harris, who does a fantastic job
  of playing a character who&#39;s less of a self-parody and more of a
  complete reversal, shunning his homosexuality (he came out after the
  original Harold &amp; Kumar) as a ruse &quot;for the p-tang&quot;.
  Harris&#39;s real-life partner David Burtka also features this time
  around, further cementing the pretension that their relationship is a
  sham. He&#39;s a really fun character that NPH brings a strange
  believability to.
</p>
<p>
  There&#39;s also Danny Trejo, as Harold&#39;s nightmare father-in-law.
  This is a genius bit of casting, as Trejo moves between his
  traditional, aggressive hard-man image, and that of a doting father
  who loves Christmas. Seeing him smile at the sight of a Christmas tree
  is the most unnerving moment of the production. In fact, I&#39;d put
  this up as one of Trejo&#39;s best films. It&#39;s no _Machete_, but
  he totally owns the character.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of the background cast is strong too. Amir Blumenfeld makes a
  great debut, Rosenberg and Goldstein return briefly for a few laughs,
  and Jake Johnson (him off _New Girl_) and Patton Oswalt make solid
  cameos. Wafflebot is very enjoyable too, proving a key member of the
  ensemble.

  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ <em>3D Christmas</em> is an 18, which fairly promptly rules
  out the original intention of this category. For those wondering, and
  presumably not paying attention, the BBFC cites the reasoning as
  &quot;contains frequent drug use&quot; which, considering a young
  child has a bad cocaine trip, isn&#39;t one bit surprising.
</p>
<p>
  What brings the marks up slightly here is that I honestly think the
  humour, clearly aimed at the teenage/stoner audience, has some legs.
  There are plenty of jokes my dad (who is very much not a teenager or
  stoner) would find very entertaining and, liberal sex/drug-humour
  aside, the tone of the film is very warm and cheery. Even when not
  hilarious, it&#39;s amusing.
</p>
<p>
  I would note though that it&#39;s not a film for the &quot;easily
  offended&quot; or even the &quot;moderately easily offended&quot;.
  But, heck, that doesn&#39;t mean <em>some</em> of the family won&#39;t
  appreciate it.
</p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ You know, there are a lot of Christmas tunes in
  <em>3D Christmas</em>. It opens with &quot;It&#39;s Beginning to Look
  a Lot Like Christmas&quot; and ends on &quot;Have Yourself a Merry
  Little Christmas&quot;. More importantly, it doesn&#39;t mess with
  them. By which I mean, it doesn&#39;t do
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU7bD1O1Quc">this</a>
  horrible comedic trope of interrupting a piece of music to make a
  contrast. Like I said in the first section of this review, the
  Christmas spirit is honestly heartfelt.
</p>
<p>
  There&#39;s also a solid soundtrack, which features what I always
  refer to as the &quot;Die Hard school of Christmas music&quot;, where
  traditional tunes are merged into the soundtrack. For example,
  <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4E6WxCnSXTnatOhejnL3GW"
    >this track (Spotify)</a
  >
  which merges Carol of the Bells with a heist theme. For me, this sort
  of composition is always a <em>huge</em> win in this category.
</p>
<p>
  And on top of all of that, a lot of the soundtrack features sleigh
  bells. What more could you want?
</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I&#39;m honestly surprised. I was delaying this one
  because I assumed I&#39;d hate it. On the surface, it&#39;s a cheap
  cash-in on the popular franchise, the readily-accessible Christmas
  movie market and the rise of the 3D gimmick (which is self-referenced
  a few times). But it&#39;s funny, nice and carries a sincere message.
  The humour is certainly not everyone&#39;s tastes, but if you enjoy
  lewd irreverent humour then this might just be the Christmas film for
  you.
