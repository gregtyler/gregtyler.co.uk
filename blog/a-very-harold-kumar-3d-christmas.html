          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ I&#39;m guessing this is one of the ones I&#39;m going to
          have arguments about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something I often consider in this category of how central a role
          Christmas plays in the plot and narrative. Inarguably, in _3D
          Christmas_, the festive season is key to everything that&#39;s going
          on. The plot centres around the acquisition of a suitable Christmas
          tree, and the timeframe is set by the family being out at midnight
          mass. Christmas parties, gifts and Santa then play a central role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The message of the film is set through Harold&#39;s development, as he
          realises that the important thing about Christmas is to be with family
          and friends, to forgive others and yourself; and how sweating the
          details is a needless distraction in this goal. In the end all the
          characters have a great Christmas, despite all they&#39;ve been
          through, because they&#39;re all together. That, to my mind, is what
          Christmas is all about.
        </p>
        <p>However, I see pot more as a summer drug.</p>

          ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ John Cho and Kal Penn have been through a lot since their
          original drug-infused trip to
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Whitecastle</a>. Cho
          has done the acting rounds, featuring as Sulu in the 2009 Star Trek
          rebirth and its sequel (as well as featuring across scores of films
          and television series). Meanwhile Penn, having spent two season on
          _House_, has taken up the position of Associate Director at the White
          House Office of Public Engagement. As such, it&#39;s really impressive
          to see them both reprise such irreverent roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some strong references to the development of the past years
          from Adrian (CollegeHumor&#39;s Amir Blumenfeld) who remarks of Harold
          &quot;Can we drop this tree off at Sulu&#39;s and head to the
          city?&quot; and explains to Kumar that &quot;I told her you work for
          the White House&quot;, with the Associate Director responding
          &quot;Yeah, like anyone&#39;s gonna believe that.&quot;

            Going up? John Cho and Kal Penn (middle) reprise their roles as
            Harold and Kumar, joined this time out by Thomas Lennon (left) and
            Amir Blumenfeld (right)
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We also see a return of Neil Patrick Harris, who does a fantastic job
          of playing a character who&#39;s less of a self-parody and more of a
          complete reversal, shunning his homosexuality (he came out after the
          original Harold &amp; Kumar) as a ruse &quot;for the p-tang&quot;.
          Harris&#39;s real-life partner David Burtka also features this time
          around, further cementing the pretension that their relationship is a
          sham. He&#39;s a really fun character that NPH brings a strange
          believability to.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&#39;s also Danny Trejo, as Harold&#39;s nightmare father-in-law.
          This is a genius bit of casting, as Trejo moves between his
          traditional, aggressive hard-man image, and that of a doting father
          who loves Christmas. Seeing him smile at the sight of a Christmas tree
          is the most unnerving moment of the production. In fact, I&#39;d put
          this up as one of Trejo&#39;s best films. It&#39;s no _Machete_, but
          he totally owns the character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the background cast is strong too. Amir Blumenfeld makes a
          great debut, Rosenberg and Goldstein return briefly for a few laughs,
          and Jake Johnson (him off _New Girl_) and Patton Oswalt make solid
          cameos. Wafflebot is very enjoyable too, proving a key member of the
          ensemble.

          ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ <em>3D Christmas</em> is an 18, which fairly promptly rules
          out the original intention of this category. For those wondering, and
          presumably not paying attention, the BBFC cites the reasoning as
          &quot;contains frequent drug use&quot; which, considering a young
          child has a bad cocaine trip, isn&#39;t one bit surprising.
        </p>
        <p>
          What brings the marks up slightly here is that I honestly think the
          humour, clearly aimed at the teenage/stoner audience, has some legs.
          There are plenty of jokes my dad (who is very much not a teenager or
          stoner) would find very entertaining and, liberal sex/drug-humour
          aside, the tone of the film is very warm and cheery. Even when not
          hilarious, it&#39;s amusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would note though that it&#39;s not a film for the &quot;easily
          offended&quot; or even the &quot;moderately easily offended&quot;.
          But, heck, that doesn&#39;t mean <em>some</em> of the family won&#39;t
          appreciate it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ You know, there are a lot of Christmas tunes in
          <em>3D Christmas</em>. It opens with &quot;It&#39;s Beginning to Look
          a Lot Like Christmas&quot; and ends on &quot;Have Yourself a Merry
          Little Christmas&quot;. More importantly, it doesn&#39;t mess with
          them. By which I mean, it doesn&#39;t do
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU7bD1O1Quc">this</a>
          horrible comedic trope of interrupting a piece of music to make a
          contrast. Like I said in the first section of this review, the
          Christmas spirit is honestly heartfelt.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&#39;s also a solid soundtrack, which features what I always
          refer to as the &quot;Die Hard school of Christmas music&quot;, where
          traditional tunes are merged into the soundtrack. For example,
          <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4E6WxCnSXTnatOhejnL3GW"
            >this track (Spotify)</a
          >
          which merges Carol of the Bells with a heist theme. For me, this sort
          of composition is always a <em>huge</em> win in this category.
        </p>
        <p>
          And on top of all of that, a lot of the soundtrack features sleigh
          bells. What more could you want?
        </p>
        <h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I&#39;m honestly surprised. I was delaying this one
          because I assumed I&#39;d hate it. On the surface, it&#39;s a cheap
          cash-in on the popular franchise, the readily-accessible Christmas
          movie market and the rise of the 3D gimmick (which is self-referenced
          a few times). But it&#39;s funny, nice and carries a sincere message.
          The humour is certainly not everyone&#39;s tastes, but if you enjoy
          lewd irreverent humour then this might just be the Christmas film for
          you.
