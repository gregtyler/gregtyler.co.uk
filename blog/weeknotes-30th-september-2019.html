        <p>This week I moved to a new office &#x2728;</p>

        <p>
          The OPG Digital team in Birmingham had a slight office move this week,
          descending from the 8th floor of our building to the 2nd. The new
          space gives us more space and, importantly, more control. We&#8217;ve
          been excited about this move for a while, and it&#8217;s exciting to
          see it finally come to fruition.
        </p>

        <h2>Metrics</h2>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ve spent a lot of the last couple of weeks setting up a new
          platform for reporting important metrics to do with the Complete the
          deputy report service. This will allow us to measure satisfaction,
          user registrations and report submissions, and interrogate that data
          ad hoc.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past we&#8217;ve surveyed this information by running queries
          on the database when asked. As well as being an annoyingly manual
          process, we&#8217;ve also variously lost track of the queries used,
          meaning the month-by-month numbers could be inconsistent.
        </p>

        <p>
          We&#8217;re currently recording quite basic information but we know
          we&#8217;ll want to expand this in the future, so we&#8217;ve designed
          the whole system to be easily extendable and expandable.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve this, we&#8217;ve adopted a system we copied from Google
          Analytics, but which I&#8217;m sure is more widely used, which
          consists of metrics and dimensions. Each <strong>metric</strong> is a
          measurement we make in the application (e.g. satisfaction, report
          submissions, errors, completion times). Each
          <strong>dimension</strong> is a way of slicing those metrics up (e.g.
          report type, browser, day of week).
        </p>

        <p>
          Each metric only supports <em>some</em> dimensions, either because
          they don&#8217;t make sense or because the way the data is stored
          couldn&#8217;t support it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Behind-the-scenes, we&#8217;re storing each metric in its own file
          which contains the SQL used to query the data and the dimensions which
          are supported. New metrics simply sit in their own file, and new
          dimensions can be added as-and-when we need them.
        </p>

        <p>
          As well as expanding our custom analytics to cover more metrics, I
          want to eventually cross-integrate with Google Analytics. This should
          not only let us see all our analytics in one place but also use
          dimensions across both, so we can for example identify the hits on our
          most popular pages split by user type.
        </p>
