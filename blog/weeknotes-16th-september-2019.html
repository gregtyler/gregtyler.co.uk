        <p>This week I decided to try keeping weeknotes.</p>

        <p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I want to practice writing prose more</li>
          <li>
            I want to step back and think about what I&#8217;ve done each week

          <li>
            It seems to be a hip trend and I&#8217;m a sucker for trends

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My key priority this week was introduced on Monday and resolved on
          Friday: implementing cross-domain analytics in our public-facing
          services. There&#8217;s been a lot of conversation about this in the
          media recently, and I won&#8217;t go into it, but it&#8217;s worth
          noting that this doesn&#8217;t cover any more information than we were
          already using.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond that I&#8217;ve been supporting colleagues with the
          implementation of our new permissions model for Deputy Reporting. This
          has been a long process, because we&#8217;re working with an existing
          app with lots of active users and we can&#8217;t get in their way.
          We&#8217;re working on the final issues now though, and hopefully will
          have the core functionality in production next week.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of the week, I started moving our build system from
          <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to
          <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>. This has meant
          restructuring lots of our assets, which is ultimately a good thing,
          but a little more change than I would have liked. I think ultimately I
          have to dive in and not be scared to mix things up.
        </p>

        <h2>Format</h2>

        <p>
          As I understand it there isn&#8217;t really an agreed format for
          weeknotes, but I like to have a structure in things like this. It
          makes it wasier to write, read and compare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each weeknote will start with &#8220;This week I&#8230;&#8221; where
          I&#8217;ll give a headline about the key things I&#8217;ve done.
        </p>

        <p>
          That&#8217;ll be followed by a general overview of the week: some
          common themes or just things I want to remember.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the overview I&#8217;m reserving some space to dive into a topic
          more deeply. This section might include technical areas I&#8217;ve
          explored, some delivery practices we&#8217;ve trialled or something in
          policy that&#8217;s taken my interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we&#8217;ll end with a little bullet-point list of single
          sentences covering all the little things I&#8217;ve done during the
          week.
        </p>
