summary: Lately, I've been in the business of picking libraries. I explain some of the key things that I look out for in a library, and why they're important.
---
<p>
  Lately, I&#39;ve been in the business of picking libraries. Barcodes,
  PDFs and automated testing suites have been particularly in my sights
  recently, but it&#39;s a topic that comes up regularly. With that in
  mind, I thought I&#39;d provide a guide of things I look out for when
  picking what to use. A buying guide for software libraries, if you
  will.
</p>
<p>
  Picking the best library is an important decision. Moreover, selecting
  poorly has the potential to really hinder your project in the future.
  Unfortunately, there are a lot of complex considerations to factor in
  to your decision. I think all of the ones I list here are important,
  but the weight put on each will differ between projects, people and
  subject matter. I&#39;d be really interested to hear how important you
  think each of them is, as well as anything else you take into
  consideration.
</p>
<p>
  I should note that, due to personal experience, this mainly comes from
  the point-of-view of picking JavaScript libraries, but I believe
  it&#39;s completely transferable to other languages too.
</p>
<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>
  I doubt you&#39;ll be surprised to see this high up in the list. If
  you&#39;re picking a barcode library and it doesn&#39;t produce
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39">Code 39</a> then
  it&#39;s immediately out. Of course, not all functionality is as
  clearly nuanced as this so, if you can, it helps to identify up-front
  exactly what you need it to be able to do. I also try and think to the
  future, and what functionality we might need for the next iteration,
  or if we get funding to expand what we do with it.
</p>
<p>
  When you get into shortlisting territory, functionality is something I
  find it&#39;s worth experimenting with yourself. Creating a small
  mock-up of what you&#39;re going to do with it can highlight gaps
  which might not be clear from the documentation but could stop you
  dead in your tracks.
</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>
  On the web we often think of APIs in terms of how services interact
  with each other, often through RESTful or GraphQL interfaces. In this
  context though, I&#39;m thinking more locally of how your existing
  codebase interacts with the library that you&#39;re looking to use. If
  you&#39;re using an app which is implemented solely with HTML
  (examples in Lea Verou&#39;s
  <a href="http://markapp.io/">MarkApp</a>), this decision is likely to
  be quite straightforward.
</p>
<p>
  However, if your code is going to make calls to or reference the
  library then you need to ensure that they can interoperate in a way
  befitting your codebase, the library, and your sanity as a code
  author. I think a good thing to look out for is whether the design of
  the API matches its functionality. I expect a simple barcode library
  to have one function: <code>drawBarcode</code>. A more complex API may
  imply a tool that isn&#39;t well thought out, or is only a half-baked
  fork of another library.
</p>
<p>
  It&#39;s probably important to note that I don&#39;t think that a bad
  API means that a library is bad, but I&#39;ve found it can be a good
  indicator of problems elsewhere. Plus, it&#39;s one of the few bits of
  the library you as a developer will see, so picking something
  you&#39;ll hate working with needs to facilitate some serious payoff.
</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>
  If you can, I completely advise avoiding dependencies. I still work on
  projects which use a certain library purely because it&#39;s a
  dependency for something critical. You don&#39;t want to be adding
  jQuery to every page just because you wanted to add a filter to
  tables. Whilst you might use jQuery every day now, it&#39;s nice to
  know that you could drop it and wouldn&#39;t have to also find a new
  table filterer.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes dependencies may be unavoidable. For example, it used to be
  hard to find a good multiselect or tablesorter plugin that didn&#39;t
  use jQuery, Mootools or Prototype. In that case, it&#39;s best to opt
  for something you already use. You certainly don&#39;t want to have to
  keep using both jQuery <em>and</em> Prototype just because of legacy
  plugins you&#39;re still supporting. But these scenarios are far less
  common now.
</p>
<p>
  (No hate for jQuery, it&#39;s just a good example. I still use it on
  loads of projects.)
</p>
<h2 id="file-size">File size</h2>
<p>
  Web pages are getting
  <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm"
    >ridiculously big</a
  >, and a massive contributor is unnecessarily large JavaScript
  libraries. Users hate slow websites, and slow websites very often are
  caused by bloated libraries. So don&#39;t use them.
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, some libraries will be bigger than others. The difficult
  question is weighing size against functionality. In it&#39;s most
  basic form, if two libraries give you the exact same functionality and
  one is even 3 bytes bigger, choose the small one. With more nuanced
  decision making, consider what your budget is, what you&#39;re loading
  already, and what you can afford.
</p>
<p>
  If there&#39;s nothing that will fit into your page load budget,
  consider whether you can build it yourself. It may be more for you to
  support, but if it helps your users get snappy load time and
  encourages them to keep using your site, then the cost of that support
  is easily worth it.
</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>
  Support is always a <em>huge</em> point of consideration for me. When
  I&#39;m browsing libraries, I love being able to browse their issues
  on GitHub (or hosting platform of choice). Red flags for me include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of open issues (support not being actively provided)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    No issues at all, or only issues opened by the developer (no-one
    else is using this)
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Issues closed without resolution</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Issues which have been open a long time (typically hints that they
    may be fixing the easy, small things)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Whereas things I like to see include: active discussion involving the
  developers, newbie questions answered probably (instead of being told
  to Read the Manual), pull requests being accepted from others with
  sensible reviews.
</p>
<p>
  As with anything in this list, there are of course exceptions and you
  should be careful not to draw the wrong conclusion. Font Awesome has
  <a href="https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues">3,718</a>
  unresolved issues at time of writing, but only 38 are bugs. If you
  care about your library choices, be sure to look deeper than just the
  big number at the top.

  <p>
    I had a great experience recently when I was trying out the
    <a href="http://webdriver.io/">WebdriverIO library</a>. I found
    <a href="https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/1354"
      >a bug</a
    >
    with the library and reported it, tried and failed to fix it myself.
    A developer replied within 24 hours with a fix. That support was
    fantastic and it allowed me to freely get on with my job. I&#39;ve
    been using WebdriverIO ever since, and can confidently state that
    support as one of the reasons why.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Also worth looking at: forum posts, Stack Overflow questions (and
  their answers), blog articles. You may well need support, and it&#39;s
  good to know it&#39;s going to be there.
</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>
  For even the most basic of libraries, documentation is essential for
  your new library. Without it, you won&#39;t be able to start. It&#39;s
  also your first point of support and perhaps your only opportunity to
  get an answer without having to wait for someone to reply. The best
  libraries have such good documentation that you don&#39;t ever need to
  ask for help. If you think about it, I&#39;m sure you can pick out
  some choice libraries that you&#39;ve never had to look further than
  the documentation to use. Perhaps not as many as you&#39;d like
  though.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#39;ve got time, looking through a history of the documentation
  can be a very good indicator of how the developers treat it. What
  looks like great documentation at first might not have been updated in
  two years of new versions. If documentation has only recently been
  introduced, this could mean it&#39;s a new important priority, or that
  it&#39;s not going to be kept up-to-date past this point.
</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>
  Is the library owned by a company, an individual or an organisation?
  All of them have pros and cons.
</p>
<p>
  I would say that something like the jQuery Foundation or Mozilla is
  the most preferable, because their strategy is to support developers
  like us to make great things.
</p>
<p>
  If a company owns the library, consider what their edge is. Many
  companies aren&#39;t going to support a library without a determined
  way to make money out of it. This might be by selling support,
  <a href="http://themes.getbootstrap.com/"
    >by selling premium features</a
  >, by
  <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/"
    >using it as a vehicle to promote other products</a
  >. Maybe they plan to hold future versions hostage. In many cases
  though, it&#39;s just to raise their company profile by getting their
  name out there. But you&#39;ve still got to be aware that the rug
  could be
  <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/"
    >pulled from under your feet</a
  >
  if their business case stops adding up.
</p>
<p>
  If an individual owns it, then what&#39;s their motivation to keep
  supporting it? What plans do they have when they stop? Again, consider
  what would happen if you were to
  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/"
    >lose it overnight</a
  >.
</p>
<h2 id="ability-to-edit">Ability to edit</h2>
<p>
  I think it&#39;s good to know if the library accepts pull requests. If
  you find bugs you want to fix or new functionality to add, you want to
  be able to do it at the source. The alternative is forking, which
  means you&#39;ll miss updates and have to support yourself. If you
  choose to do that, you&#39;ll be supporting legacy software in your
  project and might as well write your whole own library.
</p>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>
  I don&#39;t have much to say on price because, in this amazing world
  of open source, I haven&#39;t paid for a library in years. I would
  suggest that you have to re-evaluate almost everything in this list,
  weighing up the difference in price between each option against the
  functionality, support, documentation etc. that you&#39;ll gain.
</p>
<p>
  Paying can be worthwhile.
  <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> looks amazing, and
  I understand it&#39;s well worth the price tag if charts are a
  fundamental part of your application. If something is important enough
  to justify the price tag, don&#39;t just turn it down because
  you&#39;re cheap. Though equally, don&#39;t spend money on something
  with great flashy demos without evaluating it first (I&#39;ve fallen
  foul of this many times in life).
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  Over the years, I&#39;ve picked some libraries that have turned out
  great. Tools that I&#39;ve used for years since. But I&#39;ve also
  picked some duds, even when I&#39;ve been careful. In the real world,
  you can&#39;t account for everything and sometimes you&#39;ll get
  caught out. Yet you can mitigate that damage by choosing wisely and
  being aware of what you&#39;ve got. Minimising dependencies,
  understanding the reality of support and ownership, and knowing how
  you&#39;ll use the library are all extremely valuable bits of
  information.
