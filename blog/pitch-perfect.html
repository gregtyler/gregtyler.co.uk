summary: Due to the unique way in which students pick which films to see, I recently found myself with my male flatmates watching a film about an a-capella band and their struggles in American varsity a-capella tournaments. I wasn't hugely psyched but honestly, _honestly_, Pitch Perfect is fantastic.

  Due to the unique way in which students pick which films to see, I
  recently found myself with my male flatmates watching a film about an
  a-capella band and their struggles in American varsity a-capella
  tournaments. I wasn&#39;t hugely psyched but honestly, _honestly_,
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981677/">Pitch Perfect</a> is
  fantastic. Though it&#39;s little surprise I enjoyed it, as the movie
  has respect for one of my greatest loves: mash-ups.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of this post contains <strong>spoilers</strong>. If you
  haven&#39;t seen Pitch Perfect yet, stop reading, go and watch it,
  then come back. Watching a film sucks when you know what&#39;s coming.
  Be surprised, <em>then</em> finish this post.
</p>
<p>Right. Spoiler zone.</p>
<p>
  As with most American high school films, Pitch Perfect juggles the
  usual issues of how to gain acceptance in a society that is based
  around huge cliques when you don&#39;t fall into such a stereotype.
  However, there were some extra bits of knowledge that I gleamed from
  the film that I thought I&#39;d share with you now.

  Let&#39;s start with Beca&#39;s rival in this film, Aubrey. Boo! Hiss!
  Well, not really. She&#39;s not so much a baddie as misplaced. Aubrey
  doesn&#39;t <em>try</em> to destroy the Bellas, but its her lack of
  appreciation for modern music that screws her over. And what would you
  expect from someone who is only shown listening to music through a
  Bluetooth headset?

    Headphones

<p>
  Taking a step up we find Aubrey&#39;s number two, Chloe. She seems to
  be open to the idea of pulling out some more modern tunes, perhaps
  because she has a better appreciation of modern music. Tellingly,
  Chloe doesn&#39;t listen to music on a Bluetooth device, but through
  real earphones.
</p>
<p>
  And then at the top of the pile is Beca. She first arrives at college
  with a pair of Sony MDR7506 round her neck, and then later upgrades to
  a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO (which retail at almost Â£200). No
  wonder she wants to bring some <em>real</em> music to the Bellas!
</p>
<h2 id="beca-was-never-in-it-for-the-bellas">
  Beca was never in it for the Bellas
</h2>
<p>
  The only reason Beca joined the Bellas in the first place is that, by
  joining a society, she fulfills her dad&#39;s criteria for moving to
  Los Angeles. Caring little for the group, she goes against their
  wishes by getting in cosy with Jesse despite being told to keep away
  from the rival Treblemakers. In her big move of the film, Beca
  suddenly throws a mashup into the Bellas&#39; set and throws everyone
  off their game. It&#39;s as if she&#39;s toying with the girls,
  testing them to their very nerves.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the film, Beca goes for broke and works songs from The
  Breakfast Club into the Bella&#39;s set list, purely so that she can
  get Jesse to like her again. It&#39;s selfish really, and you wonder
  how Beca wasn&#39;t placed as the film&#39;s antagonist!

  This is a great result for Greg.
