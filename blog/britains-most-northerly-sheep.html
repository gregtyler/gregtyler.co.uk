          I recently came back from a family holiday to Shetland. You might not
          know much about the archipelago, but it&#39;s very far north. Further
          north, in fact, than anywhere else in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the trip, we went to the most northern of this northern
          archipelago to spent some time on Britain&#39;s most northerly
          inhabited island,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unst">Unst</a>.

          As well as having much longer summer days, being so far north has the
          benefit that you can easily advertise everything there as being
          &quot;the most far north X in Britain!&quot; So we used Britain&#39;s
          most northerly car ferry, bought some bread from Britain&#39;s most
          northerly bakery and sent a letter from Britain&#39;s most northerly
          post office.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were some slightly weirder places to see. We stopped for coffee
          at Britain&#39;s most northerly
          caf√©-based-in-an-old-double-decker-bus, and I think we saw
          Britain&#39;s most northerly MoD listening outpost but,
          <a
            href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa"
            >given recent events</a
          >, I probably shouldn&#39;t discuss that.
        </p>
        <p>
          On our second day on Unst, I decided to up the game. Rather than
          letting the most northerly things come to me, I wanted to go and seek
          them out. Specifically, I decided to search for Britain&#39;s most
          northerly sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search took place on Hermaness, a headland on Unst that affords
          excellent views of the vast expanse of nothingness contained in the
          Atlantic ocean. The whole headland is a nature reserve, complete with
          puffins, Great Skua and, fortunately for my plans, sheep. It also
          overlooks the most northerly _un_-inhabited island of Britain,
          <a href="http://www.nlb.org.uk/Lighthouse.aspx?id=783"
            >Muckle Flugga</a
          >, which is possibly my favourite island name ever.

          As we walked across Hermaness, I got excited by every sheep I saw,
          stating that it <em>must</em> be the most northerly, surely. But every
          time, another one would appear around the next corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn&#39;t until we went as far north as we realistically could
          that I finally found my quarry. Standing on the final outcrop, looking
          out at Muckle Flugga Lighthouse, I spotted a sheep just over the crest
          of a rise to my east. I pulled out my camera and took a photo of what
          was, frankly, a rather heroic pose. Almost as if she knew.

            Regal. Majestic. 60 degrees north of the equator. This is

          This was, according to my camera, at about 60.84 degrees North. With
          just five metres to the cliffs and sea below, it was about as far
          North as I ever could have hoped.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the story doesn&#39;t end there. Just after I put the camera away
          I glimpsed, just for a second, a sheep perched precariously on the
          cliffs to the north. It was as far as it could possibly be, seemingly
          centimetres from falling to its death. Before I could get the camera
          out, the sheep disappeared over the edge, presumably onto a ledge out
          of my sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;ve got no evidence of this very, very far north sheep; but I
          swear it was there, all fluffy and care-free. Maybe she didn&#39;t
          realise quite how different she was at that moment, further north than
          the other 32 million sheep (data from the
          <a href="http://www.nationalsheep.org.uk/education.php">NSA</a>) in
          Britain, but she was a very special sheep indeed.
