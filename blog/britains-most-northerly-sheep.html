  I recently came back from a family holiday to Shetland. You might not
  know much about the archipelago, but it&#39;s very far north. Further
  north, in fact, than anywhere else in the UK.
</p>
<p>
  During the trip, we went to the most northern of this northern
  archipelago to spent some time on Britain&#39;s most northerly
  inhabited island,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unst">Unst</a>.

<p>
  As well as having much longer summer days, being so far north has the
  benefit that you can easily advertise everything there as being
  &quot;the most far north X in Britain!&quot; So we used Britain&#39;s
  most northerly car ferry, bought some bread from Britain&#39;s most
  northerly bakery and sent a letter from Britain&#39;s most northerly
  post office.
</p>
<p>
  There were some slightly weirder places to see. We stopped for coffee
  at Britain&#39;s most northerly
  café-based-in-an-old-double-decker-bus, and I think we saw
  Britain&#39;s most northerly MoD listening outpost but,
  <a
    href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa"
    >given recent events</a
  >, I probably shouldn&#39;t discuss that.
</p>
<p>
  On our second day on Unst, I decided to up the game. Rather than
  letting the most northerly things come to me, I wanted to go and seek
  them out. Specifically, I decided to search for Britain&#39;s most
  northerly sheep.
</p>
<p>
  The search took place on Hermaness, a headland on Unst that affords
  excellent views of the vast expanse of nothingness contained in the
  Atlantic ocean. The whole headland is a nature reserve, complete with
  puffins, Great Skua and, fortunately for my plans, sheep. It also
  overlooks the most northerly _un_-inhabited island of Britain,
  <a href="http://www.nlb.org.uk/Lighthouse.aspx?id=783"
    >Muckle Flugga</a
  >, which is possibly my favourite island name ever.

<p>
  As we walked across Hermaness, I got excited by every sheep I saw,
  stating that it <em>must</em> be the most northerly, surely. But every
  time, another one would appear around the next corner.
</p>
<p>
  It wasn&#39;t until we went as far north as we realistically could
  that I finally found my quarry. Standing on the final outcrop, looking
  out at Muckle Flugga Lighthouse, I spotted a sheep just over the crest
  of a rise to my east. I pulled out my camera and took a photo of what
  was, frankly, a rather heroic pose. Almost as if she knew.

    Regal. Majestic. 60 degrees north of the equator. This is
    Britain&#39;s Most Northerly sheep.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  This was, according to my camera, at about 60.84 degrees North. With
  just five metres to the cliffs and sea below, it was about as far
  North as I ever could have hoped.
</p>
<p>
  But the story doesn&#39;t end there. Just after I put the camera away
  I glimpsed, just for a second, a sheep perched precariously on the
  cliffs to the north. It was as far as it could possibly be, seemingly
  centimetres from falling to its death. Before I could get the camera
  out, the sheep disappeared over the edge, presumably onto a ledge out
  of my sight.
</p>
<p>
  I&#39;ve got no evidence of this very, very far north sheep; but I
  swear it was there, all fluffy and care-free. Maybe she didn&#39;t
  realise quite how different she was at that moment, further north than
  the other 32 million sheep (data from the
  <a href="http://www.nationalsheep.org.uk/education.php">NSA</a>) in
  Britain, but she was a very special sheep indeed.
