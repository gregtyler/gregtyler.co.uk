summary: I mistake racism-centric Shaft for a Christmas film. The result is exactly what you might expect.

  We also see Christian Bale as a racist rich white kid who gets himself
  on the wrong side of Shaft, and is handsomely rewarded with punches to
  the face. Bale&#39;s performance is solid, but overshadowed by the
  fact that his character&#39;s main development happens when he&#39;s
  granted bale (gettit?) from a crime he almost certainly did commit.

  ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Ha ha ha! Seriously? It opens with a race crime! Not
  suitable for kids, parents, grandparents, white people, or those with
  an aversion to swearing.

  <em>fantastic</em>. If you haven&#39;t heard

  then you&#39;ve been missing out, and the rest of the film continues
  in a similar 80s cop vibe. It&#39;s a marvellous soundtrack which,
  while not very Christmassy, deserves a few points here for the sheer
  goddamn quality of it.

  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆<br /><em>Shaft</em> is by no means a Christmas film. The
  music, the plot, the atmosphere; it&#39;s all fantastic, but
  distinctively not festive. I enjoyed this movie, but including it in
  the Christmas season was a foolhardy movie.
