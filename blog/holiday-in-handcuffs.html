          ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ This could have be played out with at least some modicum of
          Christmas joy if Trudie at least seemed to want to enjoy her
          Christmas. Instead, she seems to be there out of obligation and the
          general plot (that she kidnaps a customer at her café) is driven
          purely from a desire to appease her otherwise distant family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, it feels like Christmas fits around
          <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> purely because: a) it&#39;s a convenient
          reason plot-wise for Trudie to have to see her family b) seasonal
          films often make bare money on DVD releases.

          ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ So Melissa Joan Hart was the live-action Sabrina The Teenage
          Witch for 7 years, but I still didn&#39;t recognise her at all and
          only learnt this fact after looking up the film on IMDb. Meanwhile,
          Mario Lopez (who plays our unfortunate kidnapee) is very familiar, and
          I have no idea why. No-one&#39;s particularly good in this though.

          That all said, fair shoutout to
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001478/">June Lockhart</a> who
          plays &quot;Grandma&quot; and has a nice comic moment when the police
          finally arrive to finish this dreary toss, as she shouts &quot;I
          don&#39;t know who brought in the bacon, but I&#39;m going to fry it
          up in a pan&quot; whilst brandishing an ancient firearm. It&#39;s a
          rare piece of entertainment in a mire of lameness.

          ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆<br />This fits into that sub-genre of nonsense-y trashy
          films that I sometimes quite like, but
          <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> doesn&#39;t cut the mustard. It&#39;s
          just really rather poor. Maybe, if I&#39;d had a few glasses of mulled
          wine and watched it with a few friends, I could have found the funny
          side; but it just didn&#39;t gel for me.

          If you strangely desire to watch _Holiday in Handcuffs_, you can find
          it &#8211; with international subtitles &#8211;
