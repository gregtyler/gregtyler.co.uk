summary: Melissa Joan Hart handcuffs a blogger for an hour and a half and forces him to spend time with her boring, annoying family. Or something like that.

  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ This could have be played out with at least some modicum of
  Christmas joy if Trudie at least seemed to want to enjoy her
  Christmas. Instead, she seems to be there out of obligation and the
  general plot (that she kidnaps a customer at her café) is driven
  purely from a desire to appease her otherwise distant family.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, it feels like Christmas fits around
  <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> purely because: a) it&#39;s a convenient
  reason plot-wise for Trudie to have to see her family b) seasonal
  films often make bare money on DVD releases.

  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ So Melissa Joan Hart was the live-action Sabrina The Teenage
  Witch for 7 years, but I still didn&#39;t recognise her at all and
  only learnt this fact after looking up the film on IMDb. Meanwhile,
  Mario Lopez (who plays our unfortunate kidnapee) is very familiar, and
  I have no idea why. No-one&#39;s particularly good in this though.

  That all said, fair shoutout to
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001478/">June Lockhart</a> who
  plays &quot;Grandma&quot; and has a nice comic moment when the police
  finally arrive to finish this dreary toss, as she shouts &quot;I
  don&#39;t know who brought in the bacon, but I&#39;m going to fry it
  up in a pan&quot; whilst brandishing an ancient firearm. It&#39;s a
  rare piece of entertainment in a mire of lameness.

    This painting, drawn up by the main character, was quite good.

  because it is based around a tremendously broken family.

  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆<br/>This fits into that sub-genre of nonsense-y trashy
  films that I sometimes quite like, but
  <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> doesn&#39;t cut the mustard. It&#39;s
  just really rather poor. Maybe, if I&#39;d had a few glasses of mulled
  wine and watched it with a few friends, I could have found the funny
  side; but it just didn&#39;t gel for me.

  If you strangely desire to watch _Holiday in Handcuffs_, you can find
  it &#8211; with international subtitles &#8211;
