            >James Bond continues his search for Blofeld after their t√™te-√†-t√™te
            in Japan. At one point, he spends some time in Blofeld&#39;s company
            over the Christmas period.</em
          >

        <p>
          Let&#39;s not beat around the bush here. I&#39;ve watched a lot of
          Christmas films recently and fancied something a bit different. Having
          realised some of OHMSS takes place on Christmas Eve, I thought I might
          as well cash-in on it.
        </p>
        <h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ The most festive person in this film is Ernst Stavro Blofeld
          (now The Count de Bleuchamp) who, like some under-dressed evil-minded
          Santa, provides the only gifts we see exchanged over Christmas.
          Admittedly these gifts are biological agents that will be used to
          destroy England&#39;s agricultural yield for the year, but they are
          presents nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Points also go to Switzerland, as Bond attends the Christmas Eve
          celebrations in a small Swiss town where there&#39;s singing, dancing
          and ice skating in full force. Swiss Christmas looks idyllic, as
          people run about laughing and being merry. It&#39;s certainly a damn
          site better than the celebrations in Piz Gloria as one imagines
          Blofeld sitting around with a small cup of eggnog making awkward
          smalltalk with the assembled ex-cons he employs as ski instructors.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ George Lazenby dons Bond&#39;s boots for this outing,
          filling the incredible void left by Sean Connery after five films at
          the helm. Deeply desiring the role, Lazenby bought himself a Rolex and
          Saville Row suit to fit the character, and even went to Connery&#39;s
          barber. All of this paid off, and he was offered a seven-film deal
          which, perhaps for the best, he turned down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining Lazenby were the gorgeous Diana Rigg as Tessa (this is become
          less of a Christmas review by the second), the wonderfully-bald Telly
          Savalas as Blofeld, and the amiable Gabriele Ferzetti as Marc-Ange
          Draco &#8211; one of my favourite Bond characters. Then of course
          there are the Bond stalwarts filling the ranks back at MI6 as M, Q and
          Moneypenny all return to the fold unsurprised by Bond&#39;s rather
          rapid apparent facial surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          OHMSS is memorable, perhaps unfairly, for its large array of
          &quot;Bond girls&quot; in Blofeld&#39;s Swiss clinic, all suffering
          from unusual allergies and all from extremely disparate parts of the
          world. Undercover as the heraldry expert Sir Hilary Bray, Bond has to
          pretend to not be particularly interested in courting women but
          &#8211; despite his upcoming marriage &#8211; promptly becomes a
          two-a-night sort of chap.

          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ I watched this with my Dad and we had a great time! But
          honesty is due. Some of the death scenes are a bit brutal (someone
          goes into a snow-churning machine, another falls a very long way off a
          cliff, which we witness all of). There&#39;s also a healthy smattering
          of misogyny and domestic abuse, though Marc-Ange&#39;s witticism about
          sparing the rod does overshadow one of them. Honestly, I think the
          amount of fun your family will have with this film rather depends on
          the sort of family you&#39;re in.
        </p>
        <h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ Whilst not at all Christmassy, the music in OHMSS is of the
          high standard that we&#39;ve grown accustomed to in the Bond universe.
          John Barry returns again to give us an amazing combination of the
          classic Bond motifs and traditional movie soundtrack mixed sublimely
          with the chosen Bond theme: this time Louis Armstrong&#39;s &quot;We
          Have All The Time In The World&quot;. Armstrong&#39;s performance
          doesn&#39;t make for the title theme, replaced by a more action-packed
          version of the classic 007 theme, but its integrity in the rest of the
          soundtrack shows once again how good Barry is at his job.
        </p>
        <h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ<br />As a Bond aficionado, reviewing Bond films is just
          wasted time. I recommend you watch OHMSS, just as I recommend you
          watch all the other Bond films. Whilst perhaps not one of the absolute
          bests, <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> is a fairly strong
          film with great characters, some fantastic chases and (amongst the
          trashy green screen) some really well-shot sequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&#39;s it! The festive films are over! Have a fantastic Christmas
          everyone.
