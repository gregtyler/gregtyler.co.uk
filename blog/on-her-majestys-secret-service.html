summary: To force a short break from films that are just _too_ Christmassy, I enjoy a personal favourite that barely even tries to relate to the winterval.

    over the Christmas period.</em

  Let&#39;s not beat around the bush here. I&#39;ve watched a lot of
  Christmas films recently and fancied something a bit different. Having
  realised some of OHMSS takes place on Christmas Eve, I thought I might
  as well cash-in on it.

<p>
  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The most festive person in this film is Ernst Stavro Blofeld
  (now The Count de Bleuchamp) who, like some under-dressed evil-minded
  Santa, provides the only gifts we see exchanged over Christmas.
  Admittedly these gifts are biological agents that will be used to
  destroy England&#39;s agricultural yield for the year, but they are
  presents nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
  Points also go to Switzerland, as Bond attends the Christmas Eve
  celebrations in a small Swiss town where there&#39;s singing, dancing
  and ice skating in full force. Swiss Christmas looks idyllic, as
  people run about laughing and being merry. It&#39;s certainly a damn
  site better than the celebrations in Piz Gloria as one imagines
  Blofeld sitting around with a small cup of eggnog making awkward
  smalltalk with the assembled ex-cons he employs as ski instructors.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ George Lazenby dons Bond&#39;s boots for this outing,
  filling the incredible void left by Sean Connery after five films at
  the helm. Deeply desiring the role, Lazenby bought himself a Rolex and
  Saville Row suit to fit the character, and even went to Connery&#39;s
  barber. All of this paid off, and he was offered a seven-film deal
  which, perhaps for the best, he turned down.
</p>
<p>
  Joining Lazenby were the gorgeous Diana Rigg as Tessa (this is become
  less of a Christmas review by the second), the wonderfully-bald Telly
  Savalas as Blofeld, and the amiable Gabriele Ferzetti as Marc-Ange
  Draco &#8211; one of my favourite Bond characters. Then of course
  there are the Bond stalwarts filling the ranks back at MI6 as M, Q and
  Moneypenny all return to the fold unsurprised by Bond&#39;s rather
  rapid apparent facial surgery.
</p>
<p>
  OHMSS is memorable, perhaps unfairly, for its large array of
  &quot;Bond girls&quot; in Blofeld&#39;s Swiss clinic, all suffering
  from unusual allergies and all from extremely disparate parts of the
  world. Undercover as the heraldry expert Sir Hilary Bray, Bond has to
  pretend to not be particularly interested in courting women but
  &#8211; despite his upcoming marriage &#8211; promptly becomes a
  two-a-night sort of chap.

  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ I watched this with my Dad and we had a great time! But
  honesty is due. Some of the death scenes are a bit brutal (someone
  goes into a snow-churning machine, another falls a very long way off a
  cliff, which we witness all of). There&#39;s also a healthy smattering
  of misogyny and domestic abuse, though Marc-Ange&#39;s witticism about
  sparing the rod does overshadow one of them. Honestly, I think the
  amount of fun your family will have with this film rather depends on
  the sort of family you&#39;re in.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Whilst not at all Christmassy, the music in OHMSS is of the
  high standard that we&#39;ve grown accustomed to in the Bond universe.
  John Barry returns again to give us an amazing combination of the
  classic Bond motifs and traditional movie soundtrack mixed sublimely
  with the chosen Bond theme: this time Louis Armstrong&#39;s &quot;We
  Have All The Time In The World&quot;. Armstrong&#39;s performance
  doesn&#39;t make for the title theme, replaced by a more action-packed
  version of the classic 007 theme, but its integrity in the rest of the
  soundtrack shows once again how good Barry is at his job.
</p>

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br/>As a Bond aficionado, reviewing Bond films is just
  wasted time. I recommend you watch OHMSS, just as I recommend you
  watch all the other Bond films. Whilst perhaps not one of the absolute
  bests, <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> is a fairly strong
  film with great characters, some fantastic chases and (amongst the
  trashy green screen) some really well-shot sequences.
</p>
<p>
  That&#39;s it! The festive films are over! Have a fantastic Christmas
  everyone.
