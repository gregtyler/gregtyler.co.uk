        <p>This week I went to Ireland.</p>

        <p>
          Not on a work trip, so it&#8217;s admittedly not that relevant, but it
          took two days out of my week so was a pretty key to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I came back having missed retro and planning on Tuesday, which is a
          bit of a weird position to be in: I&#8217;m doing all 13 days if the
          sprint but had no input into what went in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was broken back in quickly on Wednesday when we had a
          production-level outage at 10am. Investigation since has revealed that
          our Redis node fell offline because of a hardware failure. We were
          back up within ten seconds, but users were still impacted and that
          sucks.
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of the rest of the week was taken up with improving our error
          handling so we&#8217;re not at as much risk in the future. We&#8217;ll
          also be building in redundancy for Redis so we don&#8217;t have a
          single point of failure.
        </p>
