  I&#39;m really happy to introduce a new project that I&#39;ve been
  working on for a while, which hopefully will be a lot of help to a lot
  of people. It&#39;s called <strong>Quizzard</strong> and it should change the
  way that many of us do pub quizzes.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>
  Firstly, a little bit of explanation of my history with quizzes. Early
  in my first year of university, we found that near our accommodation
  was a student union with a regular Monday night quiz. This was the
  Pleasance Pub Quiz, supposedly one of the biggest weekly quizzes in
  Europe. We went to this every week, with varying team members, and
  it&#39;s how I got to know loads of my very close friends.
</p>
<p>
  After two years, the quizmaster at Pleasance left and the university
  put out an open call for anybody to take over and, as a fan, I
  applied. Skip forward a year and a half and I&#39;m still there, now
  writing the questions and working the desk at Pleasance with Innes,
  our other quizmaster.
</p>
<h2 id="enter-quizzard">Enter Quizzard</h2>
<p>
  This is where Quizzard comes in. Each week, me and Innes end up
  writing our halves of the quiz, emailing them back and forth and
  trying our best to end up with a cohesive set of questions to ask each
  Monday. This has never been a perfect solution and, as a web
  developer, I figured I should just make something to fill the gap.

<p>
  As I started development I realised that others could probably benefit
  from the service and started to make a more coherent platform, and
  expand what it did.
</p>
<p>
  As well as writing quizzes, I want Quizzard to be a great resource for
  quizmasters and quizlings (people who go to quizzes) alike. For
  quizmasters, I&#39;m adding forums for us to discuss cool question
  ideas, hints and tips for running quizzes, and research sources. For
  quizlings, I&#39;m adding public listings so that you can quickly find
  an event near you. I love pub quizzes and really want to help get
  people through the door.

<h2 id="the-present-and-the-future">The present and the future</h2>
<p>
  Quizzard is currently in a testing mode, so it&#39;s locked down to
  just a few people at the moment. Soon we&#39;ll be adding more folk
  manually, and slowly expanding our user base.
</p>
<p>
  In the long term, I want to let people sign-up fairly freely, but want
  to personally approve every account to ensure that users are real
  quizmasters. It may seem heavy handy, but I want to support the quiz
  community and so that&#39;s my focus. There&#39;s also the question of
  whether to charge for the service. I need to offset the cost of
  running Quizzard somehow, and I don&#39;t think adverts would be
  particularly suitable. Charging for use of the service seems like a
  reasonable solution, but at the moment I&#39;m not focusing on that.
</p>
<p>
  So keep an eye on Quizzard, and
  watch this blog for future updates. Also, why not leave a message
  below if you have questions or comments about its future? In
  particular, if you&#39;re a quizmaster who would be interested in
  helping test Quizzard, please get in touch!
