summary: It's time again to consider what I've done over the year, what the highs have been, and what's going to happen next.

  Last year
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/2013-year-in-review/s"
    >I stated</a
  >
  that 2014 was likely to be a year for settling down a bit, and
  that&#39;s been perfectly true. I&#39;ve stayed in Edinburgh for all
  of 2014, moving a bit further out of town to quieter suburbs away from
  the busier city centre. A double-edged sword, this has led to more
  consideration about how I spend my evenings since (for example) I have
  to walk more than 100 metres to get to a bar now.

  I&#39;ve stayed working for the University of Edinburgh, but changed
  teams to work on more student-focussed projects. This has been a happy
  move particularly because, as a recent graduate, the student
  experience is very close to my heart. In 2014 I helped release the
  Course Timetable Browser and updates to the Undergraduate admissions
  system and the course management processes. I was also part of making
  Path University-wide, and it has continued to grow massively to become
  a recognised part of the University infrastructure. Path&#39;s now
  much further out of my hands, which is frankly a blessing as it means
  I can spend time working on developing other major projects rather
  than things like support and training.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of my full-time work, I&#39;ve spent less time this year on
  other websites. The ominously titled &quot;London Project&quot; has
  taken up quite a lot of my time, and I&#39;ve been really happy with
  the development despite some typical teething issues. Me and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/paulhorrocks">Paul</a> officially
  disbanded Croft Media this year, which comes with a twinge of sadness
  but is frankly a sensible decision considering how much we have on at
  the moment.
</p>
<p>
  In 2014 I also finally said goodbye to
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pleasancepubquiz">Pleasance Quiz</a
  >, having sat at the front for three fantastic years (and, of course,
  having taken part for two before that). It&#39;s been sad to leave the
  quiz behind, but the preparation time was getting in the way of other
  activities, and travelling across town to attend each week
  would&#39;ve been a much larger burden. I&#39;m very lucky to see
  Angus continue at Pleasance, and a very capable friend has taken my
  position; so I could confidently leave the place in safe hands.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after leaving Pleasance, I became a regular attendee at the quiz
  at The Dagda Bar, which is slightly more grown-up and noticeably more
  challenging! On occasion I&#39;ve been seen hosting too, which helps
  scratch that itch for asking people questions and making poor jokes to
  a room full of people who&#39;ll chuckle politely.
</p>
<p>
  As with last year, the summer brought a new wave of people moving out
  of Edinburgh. It&#39;s a shame to see people go, particularly after
  seeing many of them regularly for the past five years. However,
  changing departments at work has introduced to a whole load of
  exceptional new people, some of whom I went to Aviemore with this
  autumn.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there&#39;s far more to mention socially that I don&#39;t
  want to go into as much detail with. The Fringe was as enjoyable as
  ever, and I saw some fantastic acts. I&#39;ve had some great nights
  out with friends and colleagues, from fancy restaurants to seedy
  nightclubs. My music tastes have both refined and broadened, and
  I&#39;ve started making much more effort to watch interesting films
  that I might not have considered before.

  Ultimately, despite being less exciting that 2013, I&#39;ve had a
  perfectly pleasant year. I&#39;ve met lots of amazing people and had
  great experiences with them all. I&#39;ve certainly settled a bit, and
  got more used to the world of work that I&#39;m destined to inhabit
  from here on out. Going forward, I think 2015 is going to be the year
  of doing something new. I&#39;m not sure what I want to focus on yet,
  but this time next year I expect there&#39;s going to be at least one
  thing that I&#39;m especially proud of.
