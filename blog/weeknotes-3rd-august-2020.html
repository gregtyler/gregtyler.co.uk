        <p>This week I planned lots of user management work.</p>

        <p>
          We&#8217;ve got to big bits of user management changes coming up: the
          ability to (properly) delete users and a redesign of all user
          management tools into one single application.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is some solid foundational work, since we intend to make much
          wider changes to users and authentication in the next six months. By
          unifying and modernising the front-end, and filling functionality
          gaps, we&#8217;ll make those biggest changes much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          But we can&#8217;t just wade into such work! So I&#8217;ve spent a lot
          of the past two weeks writing proposals, prototypes and technical
          spikes that need to be reviewed/resolved before we can go ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whilst doing this, I&#8217;m starting to identify common steps to go
          through when speccing work. Hopefully we can extract the good bits to
          stay building a formal process whenever we are new milestones.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next week we&#8217;ll answer the remaining few questions, both
          business and technical, and put ourselves in a position to actually
          start development.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Demoed user management prototype to business users</li>
          <li>
            Ran technical kickoff for user management interface and created some
            related spikes
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrote a proposal for deleting users and started chasing up remaining
            unanswered questions
          </li>
          <li>
            Investigated a couple of spikes which didn&#8217;t go anywhere
          </li>
          <li>
            Refactored some code I&#8217;d added to last week and spotted needed
            attention
          </li>
          <li>
            Tidied up our Jira board, still trying to get the automation just
            right!
