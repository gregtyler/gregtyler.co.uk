<p>
  For the past couple of days (I&#39;m not much of a Christmas person),
  I&#39;ve been working on live multiuser editing for Quizzard. This
  means that quizzes with more than one quizmaster (like the one I run),
  will be able to have more than one user editing the questions and
  scores at the same time, with those details being updated live on the
  other user&#39;s screen.

  There are still a few bugs to iron out here and there, but this is a
  great step forward!
