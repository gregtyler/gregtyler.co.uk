  <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> was my first pick for a Christmas TV
  special because of how many Christmas specials they did. Between 1991
  and 2003, the show put out nothing <em>but</em> Christmas specials.
  &quot;<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Crackers_(Only_Fools_and_Horses)"
    >Christmas Crackers</a
  >&quot; was their first, and the most Christmassy special I could
  find.
</p>
<p>
  &quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; is a bit of a weird episode of
  television. The first half of it follows Del Boy and Rodney&#39;s
  Christmas dinner, thanklessly prepared by Grandad. After that
  (expectedly) goes rather badly, and Grandad decides to head off to the
  Old Folk&#39;s Christmas Party, the brothers decide to head out
  themselves.
</p>
<p>
  The first half is full of class Christmassy tropes. They have a big
  Christmas spread with all the trimmings (though not all in the right
  place). The flat is decorated with tree and tinsel. Everyone&#39;s
  wearing those paper crowns. They even catch The Sound of Music on the
  television.
</p>
<p>
  Del Boy also makes a really nice speech about how important it is to
  spend Christmas with their Grandad, because a lot of people aren&#39;t
  as lucky to have family around. It&#39;s feels sweet and honest: a
  true testament to the shared joy so many have at this time of the
  year.
</p>
<p>
  The speech would be a good ending to the episode, but it actually
  introduces the turn: Grandad doesn&#39;t want their company and goes
  out himself, so the brothers figure they should head to the club too.
  After that point, you&#39;d be forgiven for not knowing what time of
  the year it&#39;s set at.

  David Jason is wonderful, a regular national treasure. Even Del Boy at
  this point feels like a real person, and it brought a little joy to my
  heart to be reminded of his wonderful, positive enthusiasm and
  ambition.
</p>
<p>
  But I added this category to celebrate productions taking that extra
  effort to break from the norm and bring some exciting cameos for your
  Christmas episode, which <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> sadly
  didn&#39;t do.

<p>
  I loved <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> as a kid, and watching it again
  now is a real pleasure. It&#39;s a funny and clever show that mixes
  witty dialogue and physical comedy, whilst still feeling quite real.
  I&#39;d say it&#39;s great for all ages.
</p>
<p>
  However, I think there&#39;s a real nostalgia influence here. There
  are lots of references to things of the era, and reminders of
  Christmas dinners very much of the 80s and 90s: not least a still
  fresh wave of excitement around festive television. I don&#39;t know
  how well that would play with viewers born after, say, 1998. Since
  that includes _all children_, I think a few &quot;family fun&quot;
  points have to be docked.

  There is not a single Christmas song, but it does have some great 80s
  music.

  Let&#39;s be honest, &quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; is definitely not
  the best <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> episode. It&#39;s probably not
  even the best Christmas special (looking at you, _<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93bAdEf0pzc"
    >Hereos and Villains</a
  >_). But it&#39;s entertaining, pleasant, and really captures the vibe
  of Christmas in Britain before the turn of the millenium.
</p>
<p>
  I think this is a solid start to my Christmas TV specials this year.
  It brings a bit of festive mirth, some deep-set nostalgia and a couple
  of reminders of what makes this time of year so important to people
  around the world. I expect much more of that on all fronts in the
  coming weeks.
