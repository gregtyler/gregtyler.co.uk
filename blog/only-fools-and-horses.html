          <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> was my first pick for a Christmas TV
          special because of how many Christmas specials they did. Between 1991
          and 2003, the show put out nothing <em>but</em> Christmas specials.
          &quot;<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Crackers_(Only_Fools_and_Horses)"
            >Christmas Crackers</a
          >&quot; was their first, and the most Christmassy special I could
          find.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; is a bit of a weird episode of
          television. The first half of it follows Del Boy and Rodney&#39;s
          Christmas dinner, thanklessly prepared by Grandad. After that
          (expectedly) goes rather badly, and Grandad decides to head off to the
          Old Folk&#39;s Christmas Party, the brothers decide to head out
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first half is full of class Christmassy tropes. They have a big
          Christmas spread with all the trimmings (though not all in the right
          place). The flat is decorated with tree and tinsel. Everyone&#39;s
          wearing those paper crowns. They even catch The Sound of Music on the
          television.
        </p>
        <p>
          Del Boy also makes a really nice speech about how important it is to
          spend Christmas with their Grandad, because a lot of people aren&#39;t
          as lucky to have family around. It&#39;s feels sweet and honest: a
          true testament to the shared joy so many have at this time of the
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The speech would be a good ending to the episode, but it actually
          introduces the turn: Grandad doesn&#39;t want their company and goes
          out himself, so the brothers figure they should head to the club too.
          After that point, you&#39;d be forgiven for not knowing what time of
          the year it&#39;s set at.
        </p>

        <p>‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ</p>
        <p>
          David Jason is wonderful, a regular national treasure. Even Del Boy at
          this point feels like a real person, and it brought a little joy to my
          heart to be reminded of his wonderful, positive enthusiasm and
          ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I added this category to celebrate productions taking that extra
          effort to break from the norm and bring some exciting cameos for your
          Christmas episode, which <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> sadly
          didn&#39;t do.
        </p>

        <p>
          I loved <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> as a kid, and watching it again
          now is a real pleasure. It&#39;s a funny and clever show that mixes
          witty dialogue and physical comedy, whilst still feeling quite real.
          I&#39;d say it&#39;s great for all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I think there&#39;s a real nostalgia influence here. There
          are lots of references to things of the era, and reminders of
          Christmas dinners very much of the 80s and 90s: not least a still
          fresh wave of excitement around festive television. I don&#39;t know
          how well that would play with viewers born after, say, 1998. Since
          that includes _all children_, I think a few &quot;family fun&quot;
          points have to be docked.

        <p>
          There is not a single Christmas song, but it does have some great 80s
          music.
        </p>
        <h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
        <p>‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ</p>
        <p>
          Let&#39;s be honest, &quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; is definitely not
          the best <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> episode. It&#39;s probably not
          even the best Christmas special (looking at you, _<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93bAdEf0pzc"
            >Hereos and Villains</a
          >_). But it&#39;s entertaining, pleasant, and really captures the vibe
          of Christmas in Britain before the turn of the millenium.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this is a solid start to my Christmas TV specials this year.
          It brings a bit of festive mirth, some deep-set nostalgia and a couple
          of reminders of what makes this time of year so important to people
          around the world. I expect much more of that on all fronts in the
          coming weeks.
