    by ignoring him and instead hanging out with washed-up comedian

  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ There are some sincere Christmas feels in this, with big
  parades and creepy Santas, but ultimately it extols the Christmas
  values we shouldn&#39;t be proud of: The crass commercialisation of
  the Winterval, the breakdown of core family values, and the creepiness
  of dudes dressed as Santa in shopping centres. Ultimately, the whole
  film is about a man trying to win back his son&#39;s love by buying
  him toys, which is potentially the worst Christmas vice.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ If Arnie wasn&#39;t enough for you (and he should be), this
  film also promises the talents of Sinbad, the kid who played young
  Anakin Skywalker, and the voice of Troy McClure. They all perform
  exactly as well as you would expect.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There&#39;s something for everyone! Cool characters, fun
  slapstick action, and a few jokes that should go way over kid&#39;s
  heads. But Ted, the creepy neighbour, goes a bit too far with his
  obnoxious advances.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There are some fantastic musical cues in JATW, and it reels
  out some Christmas favourites, but as time goes on the soundtrack
  seems to forget itself and falls back on fairly standard action movie
  orchestral themes. Not top marks in class, but some rousing seasonal
  tunes do elate your spirits a chunk.
</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />Oh, it&#39;s pretty good. It really is. Certainly
  Arnie&#39;s best film of 1996 (though not of the decade). I recommend
  this for fans of fun, silly films. Particularly of fun, silly Arnold
  Schwarzenegger films.
</p>
<p>
  I haven&#39;t seen <em>that much</em> Sinbad, but I feel pretty
  confident in saying this is his best work.
