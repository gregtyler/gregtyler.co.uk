  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I equate this to cheating. Using Dickens&#39; classic
  novella as your Christmas plot is like using puppies to sell dog food:
  there&#39;s no way to fail. A Christmas Carol is not only
  <em>the</em> Christmas story, it also features three card-carrying
  spirits! Hence this category is won in two ways.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ It&#39;s the ruddy Muppets, so it is of course a charming
  masterpiece, performed beautifully by the best puppeteers the world
  has to offer. On top of this adorableness, they cast Michael Caine as
  Scrooge and <em>TMCC</em> is sealed as having one of the best
  Christmas cast lists ever. Indeed, not only are the puppets played
  majestically, but Caine falls right into the spirit of Scrooge
  perfectly and bounces off his compatriots like an absolute champ.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Again, it&#39;s the Muppets! I struggle to think of a more
  family-friendly troupe. Five stars, no questions asked.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There&#39;s some lovely musical numbers in this, and even Mr
  Caine

  himself (he&#39;s not bad too)! That said, there could certainly be
  <em>more</em> music in this film, as I&#39;m sure Kelsey Grammer will
  prove soon, so I docked it a star. Beyond that perfectly feasible
  reason, I&#39;m loathe to score anything as 20/20 because then I might
  as well give up on this series.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br/>
  <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> was clearly
  released knowing in advance what my Christmas movie criteria would be,
  and has cheated its way into being the first five-star rated film of
  the season. However, this film does oft wrestle for the throne Best
  Christmas Movie, so credit where credit&#39;s due I suppose.

  Having a favourite Muppet would be disgraceful; like having a
  favourite child. Mine is Dr Bunsen Honeydew.
