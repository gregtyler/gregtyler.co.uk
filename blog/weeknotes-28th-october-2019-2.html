        <p>This week I built the full review checklist.</p>

        <p>
          This week has been split into two major tasks: implementing the full
          review checklist and dealing with some upload/data errors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The upload/data errors were discovered as part of our attempts to
          enable organisation-level access. Out of an abundance of caution we
          were watching the application in more detail and became aware of some
          issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          It&#8217;s a shake when these things pop up because they distract your
          focus even when unrelated to the task at hand. On the plus side, these
          are actual problems with a line system that we&#8217;re going to fix
          properly. It&#8217;s just a challenge to bake that work with cadence.
        </p>

        <h2>Checklist data models</h2>

        <p>
          I wanted to talk a bit about the data model for review checklists,
          since it&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time this week.
        </p>

        <p>
          We&#8217;ve long had a &#8220;lodging checklist&#8221; in Complete the
          deputy report, which is the first stage of reviewing whether a report
          is appropriate. The new &#8220;full review checklist&#8221; is checked
          against a subset of reports, either where escalation has been advised
          or when chosen at random.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lodging checklist is backed up by a database table with a column
          for every question (e.g. has_deputy_documented_spending), which makes
          it quite unwieldy. It&#8217;s also hard to add new questions, as the
          database, entity model, API etc. all need to be updated.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the full review checklist I&#8217;ve taken a different approach:
          there&#8217;s a &#8220;decision&#8221; field, and some metadata
          (reviewer, submission date) and a &#8220;answers&#8221; field. The
          &#8220;answers&#8221; contain a JSON blob with all of the specific
          questions asked and what the response was.
        </p>

        <p>
          The benefit of this is that all validation and data management happen
          on the client side; the API just checks the JSON is valid. Changes to
          questions will be much easier, and we could expand this out to other
          checklists in the future (I&#8217;d like to retcon the lodging
          checklist into this structure also).
        </p>

        <p>
          Part of the reason this would is that the questions in the checklist
          and fairly ephemeral: other parts of the application and reporting
          care about the final decision, but they don&#8217;t care about answers
          to individual questions. That level of detail is only needed on the
          checklist itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          It&#8217;s great to get a chance to re-review checklists in this way.
          If we can update the lodging checklist too, I think we&#8217;ll be in
          a great position to sensibly and dynamically manage this data. It
          would also be one less bit of business data which we&#8217;re having
          to define.
        </p>
