  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Part way through the film it&#39;s dropped that the majority
  of the events take place at Easter. However, with Jack Frost&#39;s
  main powers being related to snow and ice, and the large helping of
  appearances from Santa Claus, it&#39;s hard not to think of this as a
  Christmas film. For sure, we&#39;ve learnt that Michigan gets more
  than its fair share of cold weather.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, Christmas spirit is more than just featuring tropes from
  the festive season. The real weight of Christmas comes from bringing
  people together, spreading joy and happiness, and seeking to make good
  on your mistakes over the previous year. These are all things that
  <em>Rise</em> deals with, as we see Jack Frost not only discover
  himself, but find a new group of friends who he likes and respects,
  and with whom he&#39;ll seek to bring further joy and mirth to the
  world.
</p>
<p>
  Christmas too is about entertaining children, so animated films with
  funny characters kind of automatically get a free pass.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Being an animated film, I&#39;m jointly judging the
  voicework, animation and character design here.
</p>
<p>
  Alec Baldwin stands out as MVP for voice casting. He excels as the
  beefy, tattooed and clearly Russian Santa Claus, bringing a perfect
  mixture of charm and wisdom to the role. He also sounds nothing like
  the Alec Baldwin we&#39;ve known <em>30 Rock</em> or
  <em>Hunt for the Red October</em>. (For those intrigued, you can
  witness some

    >in-the-booth action</a
  >.)
</p>
<p>
  Jude Law also excels as the antagonist of the flick, Pitch Black. With
  his very over-pronounced accent, he reminds us of quite how well
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bls1KKDwmo"
    >Brits can fit the bad-guy role</a
  >. The rest of the cast are perfectly suitable, though don&#39;t stand
  out as much as those two. Hugh Jackman plays the (Australian) Easter
  Bunny, Isla Fisher fills the role of the Tooth Fairy and various
  children play the supporting cast.
</p>
<p>
  The characters themselves are delightful. The interpretation of Santa
  particularly stands out to me: he&#39;s a bit more rugged, more
  brutish, than we&#39;re used to, yet he is still clearly driven my
  bringing joy to the children of the world. Ultimately, it&#39;s nice
  to see someone mix up the formula a bit, and to do it so well.
  Equally, much more character is brought to the Easter Bunny and the
  Tooth Fairy, which all fits in with the highly stylised world that
  they inhabit.
</p>
<p>
  In animated films, there are often smaller characters who travel in
  large packs and add some comic value to the scenario (this is most
  played by
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323594/">Despicable Me</a> which
  puts these minions front and centre). <em>Rise</em> is no different,
  boasting four such underling creations: Yetis, elves, fairies and
  walking Easter eggs. All of them are adorable and, per their role,
  make up some of the funniest visual and one-shot gags. My favourite of
  the bunch are the yeti, who have some fantastic

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ If I had kids, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to show them this.
  Batting it at a PG for &quot;mild threat and language&quot;, it&#39;s
  suitable for the whole family and a whole lot of fun to boot. Whilst
  clearly being aimed at the children&#39;s market, there&#39;s a lot of
  enjoyment to be had for all, and the group of 20-somethings I watched
  it with had several laugh-out-loud moments.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Rise</em> plays on the idea of children believing in characters
  like Santa, resolving that &#8211; even if you can&#39;t see them all
  the time &#8211; you should have faith that they&#39;ll be there for
  you when you need them. It takes a supernatural approach to each of
  the characters and ultimately provides a good moral message to not
  losing faith in something you believe in because of one small hiccup.
</p>
<p>More importantly, it&#39;s cute as all heck.</p>

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I had a really good time with this film. It&#39;s not
  going to go down as a huge classic, but it&#39;s a really solid
  animated film that I&#39;m surprised I&#39;d never heard of before.
  This is the best family film we&#39;ve had in a long time.
