<p>
  This evening (Tuesday 15th 2013), Facebook had an unexpected press
  event inviting journalists to &quot;come see what we&#39;re
  building&quot;. There was speculation about a revamp to Timeline, and
  even a Facebook phone. Instead, Facebook announced their &quot;third
  pillar&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at 1800 GMT to explain about
  Facebook&#39;s three pillars. The first is the News Feed, which tells
  us what everyone&#39;s been doing lately. The second is Timeline,
  which lets us focus in on one person and find out more about their
  life. The third, and new, pillar is &quot;Graph Search&quot;, which is
  exactly what it sounds like.

  For years (since its inception really), Facebook has accumulated loads
  of data on all of us. We tell Facebook our relationships status, the
  languages we speak and the films we like. Up until now, those things
  have just been statistics on profile page, unexplorable.
</p>
<p>
  Graph Search allows for natural language queries. That is, you can ask
  it to find &quot;My friends who like Game of Thrones&quot;, and
  it&#39;ll do just that. It extends across most of the network,
  primarily incorporating likes, places and people. Ultimately, you can
  search for &quot;My friends in Edinburgh who like Lord of the Rings
  and are students&quot; to organise the ultimate viewing party.
</p>
<h2 id="complex-queries">Complex queries</h2>
<p>
  As well as finding your friends, you&#39;ll be able to explore the
  graph at different levels. For example, if you were at a friends
  birthday and met someone called Chris who went to Stanford, you could
  search Facebook for &quot;People named Chris who are friends of Lars
  and went to Stanford University&quot;. No longer should hazy memories
  from nights out limit you keeping in touch with the people you met!
</p>

<p>
  Higher up the social graph, you can find &quot;Bars in Dublin liked by
  people who live in Dublin&quot; with aggregated results to find you
  the best bars in the Irish capital, according to locals. One example
  Facebook demonstrated at their event too was &quot;Music liked by
  people who like Mitt Romney&quot; which, if nothing else, will be very
  interesting to statisticians.
</p>
<p>
  A particularly nice demonstration was &quot;Videos by TV shows my
  friends like&quot;, which immediately provided an index of clips from
  Archer, 30 Rock and the other most popular shows amongst your
  community.
</p>
<p>
  For searches where Facebook can&#39;t help (&quot;Weather in
  Edinburgh&quot;, &quot;Bon Iver&#39;s latest album&quot;), Bing is now
  nicely integrated to search the rest of the web. Says Mark Zuckerberg,
  &quot;We don&#39;t think a lot of people will come to Facebook to do
  web searches, but if we can&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for,
  it&#39;s good to have this.&quot;

<p>
  Predominantly, the navigation bar at the top of Facebook is changing.

<p>
  The focus now is absolutely on Graph Search, and as you start typing
  into the box Facebook will provide possible queries you might
  consider.

  On each results page is an area where you can &quot;refine your
  search&quot; to non-verbally change what you&#39;re looking for. It
  also provides some suggestions of more detailed searches you might
  perform.

  As with every product Facebook releases there are questions about
  privacy, and there will continue to be people who don&#39;t understand
  but I&#39;ll point out here that
  <em>privacy settings are the same as everywhere else on Facebook</em>.
  If you don&#39;t let strangers see your account, they can&#39;t search
  for you. If you hide certain bits of data, like your relationship
  status, you won&#39;t show up in search results for &quot;friends of
  friends who are single&quot; or similar.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, Facebook noted that 10% of their worldwide computing power is
  put towards calculating privacy settings and determining whether a
  certain nugget of data should be visible to you.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#39;re a privacy worrier, you can use your
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/me/allactivity">Activity Log</a> to
  check who can see certain bits of information about you. There&#39;s
  also a privacy shortcut button in the top right-hand corner of
  Facebook now.
</p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-great">Why this is great</h2>
<p>
  Frankly, this is what we should expect from a &quot;social
  network&quot;. The ability to actually browse information socially and
  use it to find interesting new things, like music that our friends
  recommend, is the entire raison d&#39;Ãªtre for social networks. Rather
  than friends having to write posts saying &quot;you should listen to
  this band&quot; or &quot;you should check out this restaurant&quot;,
  we can now find those things organically, when we want to know.
</p>
<p>
  Also, Facebook search has always been crap. Funny how they flipped
  that round.
