        <p>This week I finished off my Complete the deputy report work.</p>

        <p>
          It was a bit of a slow handover week this week, since from next Monday
          I&#8217;m moving to a new team. I finished off some final stories,
          updated some documentation and and slowly slinked into the shadows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having said that, I have two tickets to release still so will have to
          dip in next week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amongst that time though we&#8217;ve made some important progress.
          There was a full end-to-end test of our documents integration on
          Friday (successfully!) and we&#8217;re now recording much better
          reference data behind-the-scenes (it&#8217;ll start to be used in
          coming weeks).
        </p>

        <p>
          Next week, I&#8217;ll be picking up new tools, datasets, colleagues
          and learning about a different development/CI process. Hopefully
          I&#8217;ll have a bug fix out by the end of the week, but the main
          goal is just to get on top of things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;m excited to pick up something new and be able to focus on
          since topics I really care about (usability, accessibility,
          performance) in the front end space.
