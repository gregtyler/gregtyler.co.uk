  There are so many Christmas films. So, so many. From the
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406649/"
    >musical version of A Christmas Carol</a
  >
  starring Kelsey Grammer to
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2308733/">Home Alone 5</a>, by
  God do we like cashing in on the festive spirit. Sky Movies even have
  <a href="http://skymovies.sky.com/sky-movies-christmas"
    >a TV channel</a
  >
  dedicated to the damn things.
</p>
<p>
  Now I&#39;ve often quite publicly voiced my opinions about Christmas.
  In case you don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a touch of the Ebenezer about
  me. However, I do love films. And my love for films will outweigh my
  displeasure over Christmas any day. So this Christmas, I want to get
  into the Christmas spirit by watching some of the best (and worst)
  Christmas movies.
</p>
<p>
  I&#39;m going to rate each movie on its Christmas spirit, its cast
  list, how suitable it is for the family, and the quality of the
  Christmas music used throughout.
</p>

  Below is the list of films I&#39;ve watched so far, plus a link to
  their writeups. Please do suggest any more in the comments or on
