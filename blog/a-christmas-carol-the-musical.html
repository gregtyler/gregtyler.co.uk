  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ As I said in
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-muppet-christmas-carol/"
    >my review for The Muppet Christmas Carol</a
  >, playing the plot from A Christmas Carol is almost cheating. It is
  the seminal festive story, grandly explaining the joy and celebration
  of Christmas, and challenging those not in the spirit. It needs not
  trashy TV, commercialisation and big red Santas, but instead extols
  the virtues of spending a day away from work, with your family, and
  searching for joy in all you can. This is <em>the</em> Christmas
  story.

  <em>(We open in an executive boardroom, circa 2003.)</em><br/>
  <strong>Executive 1:</strong> So we&#39;re going with the musical
  Christmas Carol. Who&#39;s going to play Scrooge?<br/>
  <strong>Executive 2:</strong> There&#39;s no-one left! The Muppets
  took Michael Caine, the perfect Ebenezer, and we&#39;ve been
  struggling for someone suitable ever since.<br/>
  <strong>Executive 3:</strong> We&#39;ve missed out on Tim Curry and
  Patrick Stewart too.<br/>
  <em
    >(The room breathes a collective sigh of worry. There&#39;s a long
    pause.)</em
  ><br/>
  <strong>Executive 2:</strong> What about Kelsey Grammer? He&#39;d be
  fantastic! That voice! &quot;You boy! What day is it?&quot;<br/>
  <em>(The executives all nod in agreement.)</em><br/>
  <strong>Executive 1:</strong> Can he sing though? This is a musical
  after all?<br/>
  <strong>Executive 2:</strong> Of course he can! It&#39;s Christmas!<br/>
  <em
    >(The executives jump in the air, cheering, and break into a
    rendition of &quot;It&#39;s The Most Wonderful Time Of The
    Year&quot;. Exeunt, pursued by a bear, who is also singing.)</em

<p>
  I&#39;ve been putting off watching
  <em>A Christmas Carol: The Musical</em> for a while, because I&#39;ve
  been scared. Scared that Kelsey Grammer, an actor I have deep respect
  for, would fall flat in a singing, dancing, camp-as-you-like-it
  rendition of what should be a gritty tale. Played straight, I know
  Grammer could be an incredible Scrooge, but I was terrified his talent
  would be lost in a loose sing-song version.
</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>
  As with the original story, current-day Scrooge leads us through the
  tale but doesn&#39;t act as the central character himself. His
  realisation provides us with windows into other stories: his
  upbringing and development, and the tale of the Cratchit&#39;s.
  Through this, it is not left for Grammer to lead the singing, but to
  weigh in as-and-when. As a story-teller he does not disappoint, as a
  singer he equally holds his mark.
</p>
<p>
  There are fabulous performances elsewhere, including all three Ghosts,
  and an excellent show from the unknown Steven Miller as young Scrooge.
  Mr Fezziwig is portrayed as well as I&#39;ve seen him, a cheery happy
  character full of life and joie de vivre.

  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ As a film that shows the development of happiness in old
  Ebenezer, this is great for so many people. However, the treatment of
  the Ghost of Christmas Future is very dark (as perhaps it should be),
  showing the ransacking of Scrooge&#39;s grave as his former colleagues
  laugh at how unpopular he is. It&#39;s the fall before the rise, but
  be warned that it&#39;s pretty deep.
</p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I&#39;m not really a musical kind of guy (despite my
  unfettered love for
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/pitch-perfect/">Pitch Perfect</a
  >), but <em>ACCTM</em> is done well. The songs are cheery, but
  reasonable. They tell stories, but don&#39;t have heavy narrative.
  There are no &quot;Christmas classics&quot; in it like Jingle Bells,
  or Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, and that&#39;s completely for the
  best. The film&#39;s music exists in its own, entirely suitable world.
</p>
<p>
  I found it hard not to rate this film against
  <em
    >Les Miserables_, which is hugely unfair. However, whilst the
    lip-syncing is sometimes completely off, there is some genuine merit
    to some of the singing in _ACCTM</em
  >. In particular, a three-way harmony between Scrooges old and young
  and Jennifer Love Hewitt is memorable as a solidly delivered piece.
</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br/>For this series I&#39;ve had to get to the films I
  watch in various ways. Some I owned, some were borrowed from friends,
  some I had to buy, some I found (<em>ahem</em>) online;
  <em>A Christmas Carol: The Musical</em> was one I ordered from Amazon.
  The biggest thing I can take away from this is that I&#39;m glad I
  bought it, because it means I can watch it again next year. And I will
  watch it again next year because, unlike some of the other films
  I&#39;ve looked at, this is exactly what I want to see in a Christmas
  movie: the passion and spirit of the winter festival wrapped up neatly
  and delivered well.
</p>
<p>Next Christmas, let&#39;s all watch this one together.</p>
