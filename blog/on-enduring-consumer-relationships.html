    >More and more companies are providing services rather than
    products, creating an enduring relationship for customers who buy
    into the brand. What impact does the have?</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  As a company, selling a service is often much more profitable than
  selling a product. For example, a £100 sale is great, but a service
  charging £10 a month for a year will net you more income.
</p>
<p>
  As such, many things that we would typically buy are now available as
  services: you can get monthly subscriptions for clothes, groceries,
  entertainment and toiletries. These subscriptions often cost consumers
  more and contribute to growing global problems of negative equity.
</p>
<p>
  They also create a much closer relationship between business and
  consumer. Whilst traditional grocery purchasing gives you the
  opportunity to try different stores and shop around, subscription
  services lock you in to a provider.
</p>
<p>
  These relationships, far from side effects, are the entire point of
  offering services rather than products. Service providers&#8217;
  successes are dependent on tie-in, and they will try their hardest to
  make it difficult for you to leave.
</p>
<p>
  This model of ever-closer relationships between supplier and consumer
  extend into other industries too. Video games have gone from being
  one-time purchases, to having downloadable content, to
  micro-transactions to the new &#8220;season&#8221; format.
</p>
<p>
  In this format, video games typically release new content with each
  season, potentially changing the game drastically. Whilst on the
  surface that content is free for everyone, most of it requires
  purchasing a &#8220;season pass&#8221;. This becomes a
  subscription-like situation: players pay every season for new content
  and features.
</p>
<p>
  The twist here is that seasons increasingly make it difficult to opt
  out. Certain features often require an upgrade, or are realistically
  unplayable without the additional content from the season pass.
  Notably, once you stop paying the season pass you stop having access
  to things you&#8217;d already paid for.
</p>
<p>
  This brings us to &#8220;smart&#8221; products: home devices connected
  to WiFi to provide extra functionality. A promise of these devices is
  that they can update &#8220;over the air&#8221; and you&#8217;ll have
  access to new features without having to pay for a physical upgrade.
</p>
<p>
  The issue here is that those virtual updates will only work for as
  long as the company provides them. As with computers and phones,
  eventually your device will fall out of favour and stop receiving
  updates. This &#8220;end of life&#8221; can often fall sooner than the
  expected life of non-smart alternative.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re really unlucky, a bodged update or a change in
  business can make your product unusable. As with video game season
  passes, you can lose access to something you&#8217;ve already paid for
  at the whim of the provider.
</p>
<p>
  All of this didn&#8217;t used to happen. I have video games from
  twenty years ago that I can still play all of. My kettle will work
  until the parts break, and I can probably replace them. But
  there&#8217;s an increasing trend to subscriptions, seasons and
  smarts, and it&#8217;s all made out to look like a benefit to
  consumers.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to buy a new TV, it&#8217;s hard to find one which
  isn&#8217;t &#8220;smart&#8221;. You&#8217;re forced to pay the
  premium for features you might not want and the additional risk of the
  firmware breaking (not to mention the privacy violations).
</p>
<p>
  We need to break the cycle on this. We&#8217;re becoming increasingly
  dependent on businesses staying afloat, and paying much more for the
  privilege. Subscriptions are masking the actual cost of services.
  We&#8217;re losing our grip on ownership.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to buy something, try to just buy it. Avoid the additional
  features you don&#8217;t need, avoid the spyware, avoid the
  stretched-out payments that will cost you more. Avoid the promise of
  more stuff, avoid the &#8220;ongoing updates&#8221; which could stop
  at any time, avoid things which randomly need WiFi.
</p>
