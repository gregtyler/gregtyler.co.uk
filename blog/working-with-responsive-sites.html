          What is Responsive web design?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our story with Responsive design starts on mobile phones. When our
          mobiles started gaining internet access, there was a growing demand
          for web developers to react and provide a version of their site that
          suited the small, handheld interface. Initially, this was achieved by
          creating a &quot;mobile&quot; version of the site. I particularly
          remember the BBC being a strong supporter of mobile sites, with
          specially-made versions of their homepage, news and sports sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web apps got on the scene too, and the mobile versions of
          <a href="https://m.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and
          <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com">Twitter</a> are perfectly
          accessible on any device, and well worth a look.
        </p>
        <h2 id="it-couldn-t-last-">It couldn&#39;t last&#8230;</h2>
        <p>
          The mobile sites worked well for a long while, but soon a new problem
          reared its head. As smart phones came into the market, screen sizes
          got bigger and mobile sites seemed somewhat lacking. Then tablets
          showed up with their &quot;just slightly smaller than a laptop&quot;
          screen size, and they just didn&#39;t have a natural home. Mobile
          sites looked ridiculous scaled up but any site designed to fit at
          1000px (a fairly standard design size) would look squashed up on a
          tablet&#39;s, say, 768px screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter responsive web design! The main concept of RWD is that sites
          will work at any screen size (they &quot;respond&quot; to changes in
          resolution). This means that, rather than having a mobile version, a
          desktop version and a tablet version of your site, there is one golden
          design that is shown to all devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this concept twists your mind, take a look at
          <a href="http://mediaqueri.es/">mediaqueri.es</a>, a directory of
          great responsive designs. Alternatively, visit one of the sites in the
          first paragraph and try resizing your web browser to see what happens.
        </p>
        <h2 id="designing-responsively">Designing responsively</h2>
        <p>
          A phrase often heard when talking about responsive design is
          &quot;mobile first&quot;. Generally, this is the idea that rather than
          building a website for a desktop screen and scaling down, you should
          start with a mobile version and scale up. It&#39;s a nice idea, but I
          dispute its helpfulness when trying to create a full site. My approach
          is much more of &quot;content first, on all screen sizes&quot;; I
          believe that your content should lead your design and, rather than
          focusing on mobile, you should always be considering every possible
          resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m sure this concept wouldn&#39;t fly for a lot of people, since
          it makes design development very much a bit-by-bit process, as each
          small element of the site is organised. I find it to work well though
          and particularly like that, since each part of the site is responsive
          in itself, I can cut and change elements a lot more casually.
        </p>
        <h2 id="responsive-quizzard">Responsive Quizzard</h2>
        <p>
          When I started <a href="/projects/introducing-quizzard">Quizzard</a>,
          I was immediately aware that I wanted a responsive site. Here I&#39;ll
          take you through the example of a forum thread on Quizzard, and how my
          &quot;content first, on all screen sizes&quot; policy applied to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            class="size-full wp-image-1194"
            src="/images/qu-forum-contrast.png"
            alt="A forum thread on Quizzard seen on a desktop and on a mobile device."
            width="1330"
            height="664"
            srcset="
              /images/qu-forum-contrast.png         1330w,
              /images/qu-forum-contrast-300x150.png  300w,
              /images/qu-forum-contrast-768x383.png  768w,
              /images/qu-forum-contrast-625x312.png  625w
            "
            sizes="(max-width: 1330px) 100vw, 1330px"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Above you can see a thread on Quizzard&#39;s forums (albeit a fake
          one) shown on both a desktop and a mobile device. Hopefully it&#39;s
          immediately obvious that the two screens show exactly the same
          content, they just present it slightly differently. This demonstrates
          the &quot;content first&quot; belief. My most important goal here was
          that every screen would show the posts, and who wrote them. I&#39;ll
          do another blog post in the future about how this fits in to my
          thoughts on forum design in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, note how both the screens show the thread in different ways.
          On the desktop screen, I&#39;ve used the extra width to throw a card
          to the side with the user&#39;s details on it. On the mobile screen,
          this information appears above the post and takes up noticeably less
          of the screen. This is the essence of designing responsively: Start
          with the content, work around it, and work on every screen size at
          once.
