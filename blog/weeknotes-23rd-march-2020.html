        <p>This week I prepared the runway for Symfony 4.</p>

        <p>
          Complete the deputy report currently runs on Symfony 3.4, which is
          falling out of support this November. Before then we&#8217;re planning
          to do a double upgrade to version 5. As well as giving us a supported
          version of the framework, we&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of the
          latest features and build a best-practice application.
        </p>

        <p class="has-text-align-left">
          However, a lot has changed between versions 3 and 5. And it turns out
          we never fully upgraded from version 2, so we&#8217;re lagging way
          behind where we need to be. We still need to switch properly to
          dependency injection, update our folder structure and change lots of
          peer dependencies.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few years ago I would&#8217;ve laughed in the face of this task and
          &#8220;just done it&#8221;. I&#8217;d upgrade to version 5, start
          fixing things which don&#8217;t work, and inevitably have a code
          freeze during this whole process.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the ensuing months I&#8217;d find things which didn&#8217;t work
          and weren&#8217;t covered by tests, things I didn&#8217;t fix
          properly, and improvements that I missed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, I&#8217;ve learnt from my experiences and am treating
          this now carefully. I&#8217;ve read through all the upgrade notes,
          identitied breaking changes that affect us and broken them down into
          manageable tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly, I&#8217;ve identified which if these tasks can be
          done before actually performing the upgrade (as it turns out, most of
          them). So now we can slowly fix things in the background before taking
          the plunge. There&#8217;ll still be some issues I&#8217;m sure, but
          they&#8217;ll be easier to deal with because a lot of the noise is
          resolved.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the version 4 upgrade is done, we&#8217;ll do the same for
          version 5: fix everything we can up-front then upgrade cleanly when
          ready.
        </p>

        <p>
          There&#8217;s one big gap in my knowledge: Symfony Flex. I don&#8217;t
          yet understand what it&#8217;s for, how it works, or if we need it. I
          need to do more research to figure out what benefits it&#8217;ll give
          us and when is easiest to install (it&#8217;s new in version 4 but I
          suspect easiest to install <em>after</em> our version 5 upgrade is
          fully complete).
        </p>

        <p>
          This task will be a marathon, not a sprint, and I&#8217;ll keep
          updated on how it progresses.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Planned our Symfony 4 upgrade and started the preparation work
          </li>
          <li>
            Finished designing the documents admin panel, though this will need
            revisiting because AS has made massive strides with the integration
            work &#x1f389;
          </li>
          <li>More admin panel design updates</li>
          <li>
            Made user account emails and roles immutable: privilege escalation
            now requires removing and recreating the account
          </li>
          <li>
            Productive session writing React Hooks for Sirius micro-frontends
          </li>
          <li>
            We had an all-hands on Zoom, which was an interesting new experience
          </li>
          <li>
            Used video calls on Zoom, Meet, Hangouts, Discord, Slack and
            WhatsApp to stay in touch with people. This is getting a bit
            out-of-hand, we need better cross-platform tools
          </li>
          <li>
            Started playing with the be Phaser JS game development library.
            It&#8217;s got some great stuff, but isn&#8217;t well set up for ES6
            class-based development so I&#8217;m writing some wrappers
