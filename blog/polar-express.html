          ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Amazing. <em>Polar Express</em> really embodies the spirit
          but doesn&#39;t hang on to the horrible clichés others seem to think
          it necessary to use. At no point do you lose the Christmas vibe, even
          in scenes that really aren&#39;t playing it out, because it&#39;s so
          well ingrained in the plot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the real difference is that <em>Polar Express</em> is tasteful
          in its Christmas display. Instead of big bawdy, over-the-top shows, it
          relaxes to a pleasant and soft atmosphere. The art style certainly
          helps, but at no point do you feel like the festive season is being
          rammed down your throat, which is important to me.

          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Tom Hanks plays several of the main characters, which I have
          absolutely no problem with, as he fulfils each one perfectly. However,
          the word &quot;plays&quot; is odd in this context, as
          <em>Polar Express</em> is done as high-detailed motion capture, often
          completely separating the acting and voice work. At first, I found the
          mo-cap really weird, as it&#39;s a half-way mark between animation and
          physical acting; but as time goes on, the style really comes into its
          own. Everything has enough realism to feel human, and not look
          entirely computer-generated, but it still has the ability to add those
          moments of magic, where incredible scenes can occur seamlessly with
          very human shots.
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciate the art style

            >isn&#39;t for everyone</a

          this category four stars.

          ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I would happily watch it again, and would recommend it
          whole-heartedly to all ages. <em>Polar Express</em> definitely crosses
          the distinction between &quot;children&#39;s film&quot; and
          &quot;family film&quot;: whilst it&#39;s centred around children and
          their Christmas values, it really does make a huge effort to be
          totally accessible to everyone.

          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ There are some requisite carols here and there, as well as a
          few other Christmas songs, but generally it&#39;s based in cinematic
          orchestral soundtrack. However, there are certain overtones of
          Christmas somehow smuggled into the OST that help it keep the spirit
          mentioned above. There&#39;s also a bit with an elf designed to look
          like Steven Tyler from Aerosmith singing away, which isn&#39;t
          necessarily Christmassy but made for an interesting double-take.

          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I really liked Polar Express. It was very sweet, very
          good fun and had a nice, progressive plot. I personally really liked
          the art style, and the performances from everyone involved. It was a
          really engrossing, and quite different, film.
