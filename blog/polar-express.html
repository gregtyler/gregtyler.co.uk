  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Amazing. <em>Polar Express</em> really embodies the spirit
  but doesn&#39;t hang on to the horrible clichés others seem to think
  it necessary to use. At no point do you lose the Christmas vibe, even
  in scenes that really aren&#39;t playing it out, because it&#39;s so
  well ingrained in the plot.

  I think the real difference is that <em>Polar Express</em> is tasteful
  in its Christmas display. Instead of big bawdy, over-the-top shows, it
  relaxes to a pleasant and soft atmosphere. The art style certainly
  helps, but at no point do you feel like the festive season is being
  rammed down your throat, which is important to me.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Tom Hanks plays several of the main characters, which I have
  absolutely no problem with, as he fulfils each one perfectly. However,
  the word &quot;plays&quot; is odd in this context, as
  <em>Polar Express</em> is done as high-detailed motion capture, often
  completely separating the acting and voice work. At first, I found the
  mo-cap really weird, as it&#39;s a half-way mark between animation and
  physical acting; but as time goes on, the style really comes into its
  own. Everything has enough realism to feel human, and not look
  entirely computer-generated, but it still has the ability to add those
  moments of magic, where incredible scenes can occur seamlessly with
  very human shots.

  I appreciate the art style

  this category four stars.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I would happily watch it again, and would recommend it
  whole-heartedly to all ages. <em>Polar Express</em> definitely crosses
  the distinction between &quot;children&#39;s film&quot; and
  &quot;family film&quot;: whilst it&#39;s centred around children and
  their Christmas values, it really does make a huge effort to be
  totally accessible to everyone.

  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ There are some requisite carols here and there, as well as a
  few other Christmas songs, but generally it&#39;s based in cinematic
  orchestral soundtrack. However, there are certain overtones of
  Christmas somehow smuggled into the OST that help it keep the spirit
  mentioned above. There&#39;s also a bit with an elf designed to look
  like Steven Tyler from Aerosmith singing away, which isn&#39;t
  necessarily Christmassy but made for an interesting double-take.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I really liked Polar Express. It was very sweet, very
  good fun and had a nice, progressive plot. I personally really liked
  the art style, and the performances from everyone involved. It was a
  really engrossing, and quite different, film.
