In his GDC 14 session _Antichamber: An Overnight Success, Seven Years
in the Making_, Alexander Bruce talks about the history of his game
Antichamber and how much work he put into its success.

This is a motivating, moving and fascinating talk. If you&#39;re at
all interested in making video games it&#39;s an absolute must. If
you&#39;re not, I think there&#39;s still a myriad of things to take
away. Alexander Bruce is an excellent speaker who brings real passion
to a story that clearly means so much to him.

The talk is around 40 minutes, plus ten of questions and answers.
