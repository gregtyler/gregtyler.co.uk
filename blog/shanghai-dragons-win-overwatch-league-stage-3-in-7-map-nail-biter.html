          Last Sunday, the Shanghai Dragons won the Stage 3 playoffs of the 2019
          Overwatch League—and $500,000 prize money—in a nail-biting series
          against the San Francisco Shock.
        </p>

        <p>
          The playoff win concludes a marked comeback for the Dragons, who last
          year did not count a single win among their 40 matches in the 2018
          season. The Shock meanwhile put in a strong showing after a difficult
          stage, but the loss denotes a fall-in-grace for the reigning
          champions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overwatch League&#8217;s playoff finals are played in a &#8220;first
          to four&#8221; system, meaning final series can run to anything
          between three and seven maps. At the end of Stage 3, fans were treated
          to all seven.
        </p>

        <h2>Match summary</h2>

        <p>
          The Dragons started off strong, taking the first three maps
          confidently. San Francisco Shock seemed unable to counter the
          Dragons&#8217; now characteristic wide hero pool, a stark contrast to
          the team compositions the Shock have been used to competing against.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, after the Shock snatched a victory on the fourth map, Havana, the
          tables started to turn. Nerves settling, and finding a few new heros
          of their own, the Shock came back with a newfound strength and clear
          demonstration of why they held the Stage 2 crown.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Shock then faced an uphill battle, however. Per playoff rules, the
          losing team of each map gets to pick the next. The Dragons were now
          permanently just one map away from victory, and they would be picking
          every one (though it should be noted that the Dragons had already
          faced this challenge in their own victories earlier).
        </p>

        <p>
          San Francisco Shock went on to take a second map, and a third, and the
          two teams entered the final map, Dorado, with three-a-piece. Whoever
          won the map would take the series, and the stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Shock were first to play and, after an almighty defence by the
          Dragons, managed to only scrape up a single control point. The Dragons
          then had a clear goal to win, but between them and the prize money
          were the reigning champions, themselves now comfortable on unusual
          heroes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Shock put up another excellent defence, and until the dying
          moments it really was unclear whether the Dragons could do it. But
          with some clutch rockets from Dding and sniping from Diem, they
          managed to push the cart just a little further than their rivals and
          take it all.
        </p>

        <h2>Players of note</h2>

        <p>
          With many DPS and diving characters in play, there was a lot of
          opportunity for impressive individual play in the playoff final.
          Whereas previous stages have relied on tight team cooperation, this
          series let individuals shine with surprise maneuvers and careful hero
          control.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the side of the Shanghai Dragons, Dding surely must be mentioned
          first. Playing as Pharah, he controlled the air and launched rockets
          down at his opponents beneath. Keeping this pressure up from unusual
          angles, this gave his teammates the opportunities needed to break
          their defence (and Dding himself picked up plenty of kills).
        </p>

        <p>
          Diem must also be congratulated for his contribution to the
          Dragons&#8217; win. Playing his signature Widowmaker he provided
          incredible value-for-bullet, picking off the Shock&#8217;s support
          players and pressuring their tanks. When forced to play Sombra, he
          continued to control the battlefield and provide his team with the
          tools necessary to win.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally for the Dragons, Youngjin played the role of crowd-pleaser. As
          Doomfist he made some incredible individual contributions, disrupting
          the Shock frontlines and using all of the hero&#8217;s abilities with
          precision.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the San Francisco Shock, attention must be payed to ChoiHyoBin.
          Recognised as one off the—if not <em>the</em>—best D. Va player in the
          League, Choi spent much of the finals instead playing Roadhog. As well
          as making fine use of Roadhog&#8217;s damage-dealing-and-taking
          abilities Choi drew amazement at his hook precision, pulling opponents
          out of the air and from backlines at essential moments. On that
          performance alone, expect to see more Roadhog in Stage 4.
        </p>

        <h2>A last hurrah?</h2>

        <p>
          As well as being a heartwarming and thrilling comeback story, the
          Dragons&#8217; win is already an important part of the Overwatch
          League&#8217;s history: it almost certainly indicates a turning point
          in the team compositions we can expect to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the last year, top-flight competitive has been dominated by a hero
          composition of three tank heroes and three support heroes, a tactic
          known as &#8220;three-three&#8221; or &#8220;GOATS&#8221; (Greatest Of
          All Time). This composition has been a key to San Francisco&#8217;s
          success, as they are probably the best three-three team in the league.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout Stage 3, we&#8217;ve started to see the three-three
          composition under threat. First, by the &#8220;Sombra
          variation&#8221;, in which the DPS hero Sombra (who can hack others to
          disable their powers) was brought in to either punish the
          tightly-packed three-three team, or threaten them to spread out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Soon after that, the &#8220;Phar-Mercy&#8221; composition became
          popular. This introduced the flying heroes Pharah and Mercy, who
          together could deal a lot of rocket damage from above. Again, this
          forced opponents to spread out to ensure they didn&#8217;t all suffer
          splash damage from the same rockets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other counters and compositions emerged, with varying success. The
          &#8220;Bunker&#8221; composition was popular earlier in the stage (and
          its delightfully named variant, the &#8220;Pirate Ship&#8221;); heroes
          like Orisa and Hanzo saw serious stage time; Ana was introduced by
          many as an explicit defence against Sombra.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout all of this though, three-three was never truly unseated
          and remained a common composition for many. Not as dominant, almost
          always with variation, but still an essential part of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Stage 3 finals may have finally put a symbolic stop to the
          composition, showing that even the best three-three team in the world
          cannot compete with a more diverse and complex line-up. The Shanghai
          Dragons have demonstrated, on the biggest stage of the year so far,
          that three-three can be beaten.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, a symbolic defeat may not be what puts an end to three-three.
          Rumours have abound for months now that Blizzard will be introducing a
          composition lock: every team must use two tank, two support and two
          DPS heroes.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this lock anticipated for Stage 4, seeing three-three defeated in
          the final match of Stage 3 will bring joy to its critics.
        </p>

        <hr class="wp-block-separator" />

        <p>
          For various reasons, Stage 3 of the Overwatch League 2019 Season has
          been its most exciting yet. Compositions have started to be upheaved;
          favourite players have moved on, and new ones have become celebrities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps most notably, Stage 3 has seen various teams rise and fall. LA
          Valiant and Houston Outlaws each took 5 of their 8 wins of the season
          in Stage 3. Atlanta Reign took just two.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Stage 3 playoffs provided the perfect conclusion to a topsy-turvey
          season. Shanghai Dragons, after a disastrous 2018 season, entered the
          playoffs as the lowest-ranked team. Yet, on their journey to victory,
          they defeated the Stage 1 and Stage 2 champions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shanghai&#8217;s win is incredibly important to them, but it&#8217;s
          also important to the League. It represents a changing of the guard, a
          new opportunity for teams who&#8217;ve previously been discounted.
          And, with the final stage of the year just around the corner, we
          can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next.
