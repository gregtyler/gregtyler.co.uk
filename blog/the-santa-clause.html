  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I was given a VHS of <em>The Santa Clause</em> when I was a
  kid and, simply because it was the only Christmas film in the house,
  it became a bit of a tradition to watch it in December. As I grew up I
  stopped bothering, but I continue to think of this as a seminal
  Christmas film.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately it really is very, very festive. It&#39;s really happy and,
  despite approaching some touchy subjects, retains a lovely sense of
  humour. Even at the start, as the scene is set that Scott&#39;s
  relationship with his son is a mess, there are adorable jokes.
  It&#39;s this consistency that makes the film so suitable: it
  doesn&#39;t lose itself, even when being poignant.
</p>
<p>
  From a flatter point of view: there&#39;s snow, elves, presents, happy
  families, carols, the whole business. I find it interesting that
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/jingle-all-the-way/"
    >Jingle All The Way</a

  has pretty much the same plot, but with a lot of the Christmas taken
  out.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ There must have been some Hollywood executive who, on paper,
  thought the casting of Tim Allen as Santa was going to be a greatly
  regrettable mistake. However, he really pulls off the role. Of course,
  as with any Tim Allen work these days, it&#39;s hard not to hear Buzz
  Lightyear delivering the lines but, when this first came around in
  &#39;94 he would&#39;ve been known as the voice of Tim Taylor from
  Home Improvement. He&#39;s great though. His best work beyond
  <em>Toy Story 3</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, let&#39;s talk elves. They&#39;re all played by children and some
  are really great. First up is Bernard, played by David Krumholtz. You
  may know David from Numb3rs, or 10 Things I Hate About You, or
  Serenity, or Superbad, or Harold &amp; Kumar. But you wouldn&#39;t
  have known this 15 year-old Krumholtz as <em>The Santa Clause</em> in
  some ways marks the start of his career. Then honourable mentions to
  Judy (Bernard&#39;s second), Quintin (A lovely homage to the Bond
  franchise&#39;s Q) and the leader of E.L.F.S (the rather shoe-horned
  acronym for Elite Liberating Flight Squad). None of them have gone on
  to much since, but perhaps it&#39;s best that we remember them for the
  great roles they played in this classic!

<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ <em>The Santa Clause</em> tackles some very serious family
  issues, as the characters are based around an unhappy divorce which
  leads to a dispute over visitation rights. It holds together, though,
  because all the arguing is done in a very light-hearted accessible
  manner, punctuated by fantastic one-liners from Scott Calvin.
</p>
<p>
  I watched this with a group of pals and we all sided with Scott who,
  despite being grumpy, was very witty and cutting. He also gets a
  little poignant speech explaining what family values mean to him,
  which is adorable. It amuses me though, that Wikipedia&#39;s editors
  don&#39;t agree. The lead is dryly described as &quot;a cynical,
  ordinary man who becomes Santa Claus over the course of 11
  months&quot; whilst his wife&#39;s annoying, boring new partner gets
  the rather kind &quot;a gentle, well-meaning, yet critical
  psychiatrist&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  As a kid, I wanted to be the Charlie (the son). As I grow up, I want
  to be more like Scott. He&#39;s a bit grumpy, a bit mad, but as soon
  as he sees what Santa means to people, he commits 100% to the role. If
  I&#39;m ever put in that situation, I only hope I can be as keen.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Plenty of good Christmas songs in here, including some
  choral work, solo pieces and even that one time Alvin and the
  Chipmunks covered &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#39; to Town&quot;.
  Ultimately, a very suitable selection.
</p>
<p>
  If the music is too much for you in the festive season, there are
  still a few fantastic musical cues: Scott eating piles of food to the
  Jeopardy theme tune, a heartbeat playing Jingle Bells, and a
  slow-motion walk by the elves to ZZ Top&#39;s &quot;Give Me All Your
  Lovin&#39;&quot;.

<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br />Before this evening, I couldn&#39;t work out if this
  film was any good or just fond memories; I now conclude that, yes,
  this film is rather excellent. I grinned the whole way through, and
  laughed for most of it too. We had a room of people of different
  senses of humour, nationalities and backgrounds, some who&#39;d seen
  the film before, and some who hadn&#39;t. We unanimously concluded
  that this was the Christmas classic we all wanted to see.
</p>
<p>
  There was a bit of a division over what we thought of the CGI in
  <em>The Santa Clause</em>. I think the issue is that the film tries to
  overstep the mark a bit for the era. This was the same year as
  <em>The Lion King_, but also as _Speed</em>.
