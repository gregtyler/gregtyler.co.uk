summary: YouTube is the 3rd most visited site on the Internet. It's available in 61 languages and, with 72 hours of content uploaded every minute, it caters for hundreds of millions of users. Inevitably, designing your site to please every one of those people is an impossible task.

  YouTube is the
  <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">3rd most visited site</a> on
  the Internet. It&#8217;s available in 61 languages and, with
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html"
    >72 hours of content uploaded every minute</a
  >, it caters for hundreds of millions of users. Inevitably, designing
  your site to please every one of those people is an impossible task.
</p>
<p>
  YouTube certainly gains a lot of commentary regarding its layout and
  design (perhaps second only to Facebook, who sometimes seem to have
  one of the most unhappy user bases of all time), and I&#8217;m sure we
  can all point out things that we&#8217;d like done differently. I made
  my own list, and I started to fix it.
</p>
<h2 id="things-i-d-like-to-see-in-youtube-s-design">
  Things I&#8217;d like to see in YouTube&#8217;s design
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bigger videos: that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m there!</li>
  <li>
    Inline comments: I want to be able to browse comments whilst still
    watching the video (this has some very specific use cases)
  </li>
  <li>
    Less &#8220;gunf&#8221;: I rarely use &#8220;related videos&#8221;,
    or the navigation to the side
  </li>
  <li>
    Better usage of the screen: Full width on big displays, a responsive
    solution on smaller screens
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t work for YouTube so I couldn&#8217;t roll out
  &#8220;proper&#8221; changes but, as a web developer, I decided to
  make a Chrome extension that made this improvements for me. In basic
  terms, it allows me to run little scripts every time I open a YouTube
  video is loaded. It&#8217;s all done after the page had finished
  loading so, in case it breaks, everything just fall back to the
  standard YouTube display.
</p>
<p>
  Incidentally, the extension broke the day after I wrote it when
  YouTube changed some of their code. So I can guarantee the fallback
  plan works!
</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how YouTube looks now:</p>
<div
  id="attachment_1219"
  style="width: 1360px"
  class="wp-caption alignnone"
>
  <img
    aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1219"
    class="size-full wp-image-1219"
    src="/images/youtube-large.png"
    alt="Screenshot of a YouTube video in my new layout"
    width="1350"
    height="1197"
    srcset="
      /images/youtube-large.png         1350w,
      /images/youtube-large-300x266.png  300w,
      /images/youtube-large-768x681.png  768w,
      /images/youtube-large-625x554.png  625w
    "
    sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px"
  />
  <p id="caption-attachment-1219" class="wp-caption-text">
    ImprovEverywhere&#8217;s Backwards Times Square prank on my new
    layout, complete with comments from people who don&#8217;t
    understand magic
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  As you can see, I&#8217;ve fixed some of my big issues. The page now
  centres around the video, which takes up most of the page. In fact,
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold">fold</a> of
  the page is just below the video (on widescreens like mine), so it
  takes up a solid two thirds of the visible page.
</p>
<p>
  Comments are on the right and, since their container is the same size
  as the video, I can scroll through them whilst watching. You&#8217;ll
  notice too that some of the options surrounding the comments have
  disappeared. I took out the &#8220;reply&#8221; button and the up/down
  votes. Ultimately, YouTube&#8217;s comments have a lot of problems,
  and I thought I could start to alleviate some of them by making
  comments stand up on their own.
</p>
<h2 id="smaller-screens">Smaller screens</h2>
<p>
  Perhaps more exciting is the responsive solution I have. I often watch
  videos in a small window on my screen whilst having something else
  open in another window (a word document, say). I wanted to make sure
  that YouTube would still be just as usable when I shrank the screen
  down, rather than overflowing from the window.
</p>
<div
  id="attachment_1214"
  style="width: 983px"
  class="wp-caption alignnone"
>
  <img
    aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1214"
    class="size-full wp-image-1214"
    src="/images/youtube-small.png"
    alt="A before and after comparison of YouTube, shrunken to a smaller window."
    width="973"
    height="555"
    srcset="
      /images/youtube-small.png         973w,
      /images/youtube-small-300x171.png 300w,
      /images/youtube-small-768x438.png 768w,
      /images/youtube-small-625x357.png 625w
    "
    sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"
  />
  <p id="caption-attachment-1214" class="wp-caption-text">
    A before and after comparison of YouTube, shrunken to a smaller
    window.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  On smaller windows, my redesign makes sure that the video fills
  exactly the width of the page. There&#8217;s no overflow, and
  there&#8217;s no wasted space around the sides. The comments appear
  below, again giving them pride of place. Below that, on all screen
  sizes, the video information appears, completely unchanged.
</p>
<h2 id="results-and-what-s-left-to-do">
  Results, and what&#8217;s left to do
</h2>
<p>
  I&#8217;m really happy with my new YouTube design. Some things that
  really bugged me have now been drastically improved. I know this
  isn&#8217;t a global &#8220;fix&#8221; and that other people would
  want other changes made, but it&#8217;s exciting to be able to move
  things around to my liking.
</p>
<p>
  When I get some time, I&#8217;d like to play a bit more with the
  header and with the video information. They don&#8217;t really work
  responsively, which can be a slight pain. There&#8217;s also drastic
  changes I&#8217;d like to make to comments.
</p>
<p>
  In a perfect world, I think comments should be &#8220;recommended for
  you&#8221;, so you can highlight comments from your friends and people
  you&#8217;ve voted up before. Downvoting comments should mean that all
  comments that user makes in the future will be rated down as well.
</p>
<p>
  However, this requires more than a slight design change and I&#8217;d
  have to start saving up and down votes. Maybe when I&#8217;ve got
  <em>a lot</em> more free time&#8230;
</p>
<p>What would you change about YouTube&#8217;s design?</p>
