          YouTube certainly gains a lot of commentary regarding its layout and
          design (perhaps second only to Facebook, who sometimes seem to have
          one of the most unhappy user bases of all time), and I&#8217;m sure we
          can all point out things that we&#8217;d like done differently. I made
          my own list, and I started to fix it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="things-i-d-like-to-see-in-youtube-s-design">
          Things I&#8217;d like to see in YouTube&#8217;s design
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Bigger videos: that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m there!</li>
          <li>
            Inline comments: I want to be able to browse comments whilst still
            watching the video (this has some very specific use cases)
          </li>
          <li>
            Less &#8220;gunf&#8221;: I rarely use &#8220;related videos&#8221;,
            or the navigation to the side
          </li>
          <li>
            Better usage of the screen: Full width on big displays, a responsive
            solution on smaller screens
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don&#8217;t work for YouTube so I couldn&#8217;t roll out
          &#8220;proper&#8221; changes but, as a web developer, I decided to
          make a Chrome extension that made this improvements for me. In basic
          terms, it allows me to run little scripts every time I open a YouTube
          video is loaded. It&#8217;s all done after the page had finished
          loading so, in case it breaks, everything just fall back to the
          standard YouTube display.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incidentally, the extension broke the day after I wrote it when
          YouTube changed some of their code. So I can guarantee the fallback
          plan works!
        </p>
        <p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how YouTube looks now:</p>
        <div
          id="attachment_1219"
          style="width: 1360px"
          class="wp-caption alignnone"
        >
          <img
            aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1219"
            class="size-full wp-image-1219"
            src="/images/youtube-large.png"
            alt="Screenshot of a YouTube video in my new layout"
            width="1350"
            height="1197"
            srcset="
              /images/youtube-large.png         1350w,
              /images/youtube-large-300x266.png  300w,
              /images/youtube-large-768x681.png  768w,
              /images/youtube-large-625x554.png  625w
            "
            sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px"
          />
          <p id="caption-attachment-1219" class="wp-caption-text">
            ImprovEverywhere&#8217;s Backwards Times Square prank on my new
            layout, complete with comments from people who don&#8217;t
            understand magic
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          As you can see, I&#8217;ve fixed some of my big issues. The page now
          centres around the video, which takes up most of the page. In fact,
          the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold">fold</a> of
          the page is just below the video (on widescreens like mine), so it
          takes up a solid two thirds of the visible page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comments are on the right and, since their container is the same size
          as the video, I can scroll through them whilst watching. You&#8217;ll
          notice too that some of the options surrounding the comments have
          disappeared. I took out the &#8220;reply&#8221; button and the up/down
          votes. Ultimately, YouTube&#8217;s comments have a lot of problems,
          and I thought I could start to alleviate some of them by making
          comments stand up on their own.
        </p>
        <h2 id="smaller-screens">Smaller screens</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps more exciting is the responsive solution I have. I often watch
          videos in a small window on my screen whilst having something else
          open in another window (a word document, say). I wanted to make sure
          that YouTube would still be just as usable when I shrank the screen
          down, rather than overflowing from the window.
        </p>
        <div
          id="attachment_1214"
          style="width: 983px"
          class="wp-caption alignnone"
        >
          <img
            aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1214"
            class="size-full wp-image-1214"
            src="/images/youtube-small.png"
            alt="A before and after comparison of YouTube, shrunken to a smaller window."
            width="973"
            height="555"
            srcset="
              /images/youtube-small.png         973w,
              /images/youtube-small-300x171.png 300w,
              /images/youtube-small-768x438.png 768w,
              /images/youtube-small-625x357.png 625w
            "
            sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"
          />
          <p id="caption-attachment-1214" class="wp-caption-text">
            A before and after comparison of YouTube, shrunken to a smaller
            window.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          On smaller windows, my redesign makes sure that the video fills
          exactly the width of the page. There&#8217;s no overflow, and
          there&#8217;s no wasted space around the sides. The comments appear
          below, again giving them pride of place. Below that, on all screen
          sizes, the video information appears, completely unchanged.
        </p>
        <h2 id="results-and-what-s-left-to-do">
          Results, and what&#8217;s left to do
        </h2>
        <p>
          I&#8217;m really happy with my new YouTube design. Some things that
          really bugged me have now been drastically improved. I know this
          isn&#8217;t a global &#8220;fix&#8221; and that other people would
          want other changes made, but it&#8217;s exciting to be able to move
          things around to my liking.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I get some time, I&#8217;d like to play a bit more with the
          header and with the video information. They don&#8217;t really work
          responsively, which can be a slight pain. There&#8217;s also drastic
          changes I&#8217;d like to make to comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a perfect world, I think comments should be &#8220;recommended for
          you&#8221;, so you can highlight comments from your friends and people
          you&#8217;ve voted up before. Downvoting comments should mean that all
          comments that user makes in the future will be rated down as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this requires more than a slight design change and I&#8217;d
          have to start saving up and down votes. Maybe when I&#8217;ve got
          <em>a lot</em> more free time&#8230;
        </p>
        <p>What would you change about YouTube&#8217;s design?</p>
