summary: A quick note on an SSL error I had using cURL with PHP. Hopefully you won&#8217;t have the same one now!

<p>
  This is just a quick post to note an error I came across today that I
  couldn&#39;t find any decent help with it. I was using cURL in PHP to
  connect via HTTPS to a web service, and came across the following
  error:
</p>
<pre><code>SSL <span class="hljs-symbol">read:</span> <span class="hljs-symbol">error:</span><span class="hljs-number">0</span>0000000:<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">lib</span>(0):<span class="hljs-title">func</span>(0):<span class="hljs-title">reason</span>(0), <span class="hljs-title">errno</span> 10054</span></code></pre>
<p>
  It looks like it might be an error with OpenSSL, or with the server I
  was hitting, but it turned out to just be a rogue space.
</p>
<p>
  I was generating a URL with a GET parameter
  (gregtyler.co.uk?getparam=somevalue), but it had generated with a
  space in the value. Now a web browser would turn that into a &quot;
  &quot; or plus symbol but cURL, for whatever reason, didn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
  So if you&#39;ve come across this problem (and I&#39;m putting this
  here with the hope that it&#39;ll be crawled for future people stuck),
  check to see if there&#39;s any whitespace in your URL and urlencode
  it.
</p>
<p>
  All in all, a silly mistake on my behalf that caused far more trouble
  than it should have. Hopefully you won&#39;t be stuck the same way
  now!
</p>
