  Last year I watched a series of Christmas films &#8211; from classics
  to pure trash &#8211; in order to get myself into more of a festive
  spirit. I had such a good time, in fact, that I&#39;m doing it again
  this year! All new films, some added twists to keep the process fresh,
  it should be a fun month! (If you missed it, you can catch up on last
  year&#39;s films
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/christmas-2013-film-list/"
    >here</a
  >.)
</p>
<p>
  As before, the selection of films is going to be far-reaching.
  We&#39;ll see some classics, but we&#39;ll also go over some of the
  more left-field flicks out there. This year a horror film will be
  showing up, whilst the Muppets will be going on a new adventure.
  We&#39;ll be watching films in black and white, and in 3D.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any suggestions, please do write them in the comments
  below, or tweet me
  <a href="https://twitter.com/gregtyler">@gregtyler</a>. If I can&#39;t
  fit them in this year, maybe they&#39;ll make it to the 2015 wishlist!
