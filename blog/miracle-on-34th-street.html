  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is one of the many (many!)
  films that I&#39;ve just never gotten around to watching, despite
  massive public interest. So when the DVD case said it was
  &quot;synonymous with Christmas&quot;, I was a little sceptical.
  Consider me silenced.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Miracle</em> (or, Wikipedia informs me, &quot;The Big Heart&quot;
  in the UK) follows the story of a man who is convinced he is the real
  Santa Claus. First spotted for his leading role in the Macy&#39;s
  Thanksgiving Day Parade, Kris Kringle (which sounds more like a
  rapper&#39;s name than St Nick&#39;s) is quickly promoted to the
  flagship store&#39;s lead Santa. He performs the job admirably, and is
  noted for giving shoppers advice about items in stores other than
  Macy&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
  Almost seventy years later, and boy do we need Kris Kringle back. The
  whole goodwill story of trying to work around the harsh consumer
  reality of Christmas is fascinating, and as sought to day as it
  undoubtedly was when the film debuted. Sure, this is a glaring advert
  for Macy&#39;s, but it tells a genuinely nice story, as the rest of
  the cast are slowly whisked up in Kringle&#39;s romantic ideas of how
  the festive season should be.

<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Well, Edmund Gwenn plays our potentially-real Santa. And,
  after much deliberation, I think indeed might be the big man himself.
  The strength of character and sheer charm in Gwenn&#39;s performance
  is captivating and, despite the ludicrousy of what&#39;s going on, you
  can totally imagine being caught up in his spell. Indeed, Gwenn won
  the 20th Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the part.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from Father Christmas, the cast is full of amazing New York
  accents (and probably New Jersey, I haven&#39;t got the ear for it).
  Broad twangs all, they draw out the hurriedness of the big city,
  compared to Santa&#39;s slower charms. Despite having a main cast,
  too, there are lots of minor characters in _Miracle_, who all help add
  to the larger world it sits in.
</p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ The film is _adorable_, which isn&#39;t a word I use much.
  It&#39;s full of lovely chuckles and giggles and, even during The
  Fall, remains big-hearted and upbeat. Despite focussing on children
  and children&#39;s beliefs of Santa, there&#39;s good humour and
  entertainment for adults too. And, since we see a family become atomic
  in the form of neighbour Fred Galley, there have to be bonus points
  awarded there.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Miracle</em> tackles the question of whether Santa exists in a way
  <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-santa-clause/"
    >we&#39;ve seen before</a
  >: adults presuming he doesn&#39;t exist, only to be dumbfounded when
  they confront him! It&#39;s a bit of a cliché but we can forgive that
  since, in 1947, it may well not have been.
</p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ <em>Miracle</em> does, a few times, feature Jingle Bells
  itself. This is tantamount to cheating in this category. There are
  other carols too, all put in perfectly nicely. As befitting the era,
  there isn&#39;t too much else of a soundtrack to speak of. I don&#39;t
  know much about the history of this aspect of cinema but, in my eyes,
  soundtracks really became a thing much more recently. As someone
  who&#39;s a big fan of the modern soundtrack, I do really respect the
  older way of doing things; in <em>Miracle</em> it comes across
  excellently: you&#39;re not distracted by additional noise and
  you&#39;re never left wanting some.
</p>
<p>
  Other films, even decades later, sometimes feel like

    >they&#39;re just missing something</a
  >.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br/>What a fantastic start to this year&#39;s film
  collection! What a lovely film. Why, it makes you want to go out and
  buy a turkey dinner for everyone!
