title: Much Ado about Noetherian Rings

summary: During a lecture series last year, I wanted to spice up the hour-long sessions we had. I spent a lot of time drawing, and tried writing notes in different languages. But during one such lecture I wrote my notes like a play, in rhyming couplets. After some vague interest from others, and for the sake of posterity, I thought I'd put them up here.

  During a lecture series last year, I wanted to spice up the hour-long
  sessions we had. I spent a lot of time drawing, and tried writing
  notes in different languages. But during one such lecture I wrote my
  notes like a play, in rhyming couplets. After some vague interest from
  others, and for the sake of posterity, I thought I&#39;d put them up
  here.
</p>
<p>
  It&#39;s not a masterpiece. The meter is all over the place, there are
  a lot of half-rhymes and I&#39;m not certain the maths holds up. But
  considering that I wrote it in fifty minutes with no preparation,
  I&#39;m really proud of it. I was tempted to clean up some of the
  off-bits, but I&#39;ve chosen to leave it totally unedited. This is
  very much the &quot;without makeup&quot; version.
</p>
<p>
  So please enjoy what I&#39;ve since named
  <strong>Much Ado about Noetherian Rings</strong>. A play in one Act.

  From the next hour we hope you yield,<br />Indiscriminate knowledge of
  the finite field.<br />And cyclic codes we hope you know,<br />For
  their properties we&#39;re soon to show.

<p><em>(Enter ANTONIO and GAIUS)</em></p>
<p>Antonio: Recall, brother, the characteristic of a field.</p>
<p>
  Gaius: The smallest positive integer such that as many ones that are
  summed make nought?
</p>
<p>
  Antonio: The exact same. Remember thee that it is prime or infinite?
</p>
<p>Gaius: Alas, I missed such a fact.</p>
<p>
  Antonio: Now form a field of sums of one, up until they add to
  none.<br />The suppose that n is p times q, both primes I should be
  telling you.
</p>
<p>
  Gaius: Then a sum of n is a sum of primes, but these be nought in any
  time!<br />Hence we find a contradiction, and conclude with some
  conviction.<br />That n cannot be p times q, and only if it&#39;s
  prime will do!
</p>
<p>
  Antonio: Now theorise that in a field, then in it thy fate is
  sealed.<br />There exists a number pn, with p a prime, the other in
  ℕ.<br />I shan&#39;t prove this in great detail, but an outline surely
  cannot fail.<br />Note ℤp is a linear subspace, and that it works with
  an F-basis.<br />So any a in F can be written unique, amongst the
  basis ℤp of which we speak.
</p>
<p>Gaius: I&#39;m afraid brother that I don&#39;t get it!</p>
<p>
  Antonio: Perhaps t&#39;would help to see it writ.<br />Here I show you
  an example, with f(x) an irreducible polynomial,<br />which has as n
  its degree, and coefficients in ℤp.<br />Now let me fall and show to
  you, the following is certainly true.<br />The answer, it is sealed,
  this ℤp[x] / f(x)ℤp[x] is a field.
</p>
<p>
  See, brother, that the powers of x can form a basis of cosets.<br /><a
    href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/files/2013/04/sumton.gif"
    >1</a
  >, [x], [x2], [xn-1] certainly form a linear space on,<br />ℤp, our
  set of coefficients, and to show they span you must be proficient.<br />Each
  element it is in the sum (<img

  />
  αi[xi], αi ∈ ℤ), so the cosets span everyone.<br />Since each αi has
  options p, there are pn choices we can see.<br />Now find a field with
  elements 9, and waste not any of our time.
</p>
<p><em>(Enter HERMIUS, a nobleman)</em></p>
<p>
  Hermius: What trivial games you merchants play, sitting by the docks
  all day.<br />With 9 elements, take p as 3, and n as 2 so we can
  see<br />that ℤ3[x] / f(x)ℤ3[x] is irreducible, in all f(x) of degree
  2.
</p>
<p>
  Gaius: And we know a polynomial with degree ≤ 3 only displays
  irreducibility,<br />if it has no factor in F, and hence no root but
  alone, bereft.
</p>
<p>Hermius: Indeed, so after all this fun, take f(x) to be x2 1.</p>
<p>Antonio: But can you form me one with eight?</p>
<p>Gaius: Nay in time, unless we have &#39;til late.</p>
<p>
  Hermius: Foolish boy, this is easy, take p as 2 and n as 3.<br />Now
  form the field shown here (ℤ3[x] / f(x)ℤ3[x]) and let f(x) appear.<br />This
  f(x) is of degree 3 and in ℤ2[x] shows irreducibility.<br />Try
  f(x)=x3 x 1, and see that f(x)=0 gives none.<br />In integers of
  course!
</p>
<p><em>(Exit HERMIUS and enter SERAFINA)</em></p>
<p>
  Serafina: Merchant men, if you&#39;ll hear me, let me provide to you a
  little theory.<br />That if n is a number we call natural, then an
  isomorphism will certainly fall.<br />Upon ℤ/nℤ and ℤn where ℤn has
  modulus addition.<br />And that if F in K are both fields, with f(x)
  irreducible in F[X]&#39;s shield,<br />take α in K so that it
  evaluated gives none, then note again an isomorphism.<br />Here of
  F[x]/f(x)F[x] and the F[α] polynomial set.
</p>
<p>Antonio: May we call F[α] a simple extension?</p>
<p>
  Serafina: Yes, of F. I forgot to mention.<br />I bid you proof, that
  much I owe, and with the 1st isomorphism theorem I shall show.<br />Form
  g from F[x] to F[α], and by ker(g) we can solve her.<br />Say F were ℝ
  and K be ℂ, take α=√1 instantly,<br />Then ℝ[x] / (x2 1)ℝ[x] to ℂ they
  will be isomorphics.
</p>
<p>
  Gaius: Such odd remarks you make today, of field extensions you
  continue to say.<br />But let us return to the matter of codes, and
  see that cyclic ones can be showed.<br />Take a word in a code and if
  it may be, that that at the end at the start we may see,<br />If this
  be true for any code word, then to a cyclic code we have referred.<br />Note
  too that there are more criteria, a cyclic code it must be linear!
</p>
<p>
  Antonio: Tell me more of cyclic shift, a concept I&#39;ve heard is of
  some thrift.
</p>
<p>
  Gaius: It&#39;s much what it sounds like brother, a smooth connection
  as that between lovers.<br />Take the last digit of a word and add it
  to the start, a cyclic shift has occurred in such a lover&#39;s heart.
</p>
<p>Serafina: Could a polynomial be moved by such a lover?</p>
<p>
  Gaius: Aye, my lady, and we&#39;d discover<br />the coefficients are
  what make the code, so 1 x2 x4 is 10101 showed.<br />Then a=10101 is a
  ring, Rn (=F[x]/(xn-1)F[x]) is the notation we bring.
</p>
<p>Serafina: What really can we see from this?</p>
<p>Gaius: That x*a(x) is a cyclic shift.</p>
<p>
  Serafina: You speak with such determination, could you show some
  explanation?
</p>
<p>
  Gaius: Alas, time falls but trust my lady, I believe you can see it
  may be.
