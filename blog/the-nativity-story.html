    >Technically speaking_, this film is an immediate 5/5 on the
    Christmas spirit front. I mean, it tells the story of a character
    who literally embodies the term &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;. And
    for that very reason, _The Nativity Story</em
  >
  scores full marks.
</p>
<p>
  I would note though that the film is deathly serious. It manages to
  knock in at a PG, but there are absolutely no laughs to be had; just
  occasional polite nods. In this regard there&#39;s none of the
  traditional &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;. But, since these story does
  in fact pre-date Christmas, I think we can let that slide.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Everyone in this is a great actor insomuch as I didn&#39;t
  really recognise them as acting. The majority of the cast are
  unfamiliar, save perhaps Oscar Isaac, since I watched
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2042568/">Inside Llewyn Davis</a>
  just the other night. In <em>The Nativity Story</em> he&#39;s
  particularly notable for his fantastic facial expressions.
</p>
<p>
  Also, fair shout-out to the three magi, who are totally engrossing and
  some fantastic banter. Probably against the director&#39;s intention,
  they seem more like &quot;lads on tour&quot; than &quot;a group of
  distinguished foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth&quot;.<a

  I much prefer that interpretation though. Anyone know of a Christmas
  film which is built around that idea?
</p>
<p>
  I very much enjoyed Ciarán Hinds as King Herod too, bringing equal
  parts menace and equal parts panto character to his role.

  <em>The Nativity Story</em> starts with a title crawl containing
  <a
    href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023#en-NIV-19490"
    >Jeremiah 23 5:6</a
  >. Fun stuff. This is pretty immediately followed by shots of Roman
  soldiers running around Nazareth killing young boys in case they are
  the prophecy-filling messiah. Not quite

</p>
<p>
  I suppose if you wanted to educate young &#39;uns on the real story
  behind Christmas, and the depravity surrounding it, this could be a
  fantastic family film. Probably not one to gather round the TV for on
  the 24th though.

  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Ooh err. There isn&#39;t really much of a soundtrack, though
  the whole thing ends with a fairly masked version of Silent Night so
  we can give a single star here!

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br/>I really enjoyed this film. It&#39;s <em>very</em> well
  produced and, although predictable, tells the story with a unusually
  serious tone. Imagine if your pre-school&#39;s nativity play was
  directed by David Fincher; that&#39;s kind of what you have here.
