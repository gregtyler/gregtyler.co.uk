            >Technically speaking_, this film is an immediate 5/5 on the
            Christmas spirit front. I mean, it tells the story of a character
            who literally embodies the term &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;. And
            for that very reason, _The Nativity Story</em
          >
          scores full marks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would note though that the film is deathly serious. It manages to
          knock in at a PG, but there are absolutely no laughs to be had; just
          occasional polite nods. In this regard there&#39;s none of the
          traditional &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;. But, since these story does
          in fact pre-date Christmas, I think we can let that slide.

          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ Everyone in this is a great actor insomuch as I didn&#39;t
          really recognise them as acting. The majority of the cast are
          unfamiliar, save perhaps Oscar Isaac, since I watched
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2042568/">Inside Llewyn Davis</a>
          just the other night. In <em>The Nativity Story</em> he&#39;s
          particularly notable for his fantastic facial expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, fair shout-out to the three magi, who are totally engrossing and
          some fantastic banter. Probably against the director&#39;s intention,
          they seem more like &quot;lads on tour&quot; than &quot;a group of
          distinguished foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth&quot;.<a

          I much prefer that interpretation though. Anyone know of a Christmas
          film which is built around that idea?
        </p>
        <p>
          I very much enjoyed Ciar√°n Hinds as King Herod too, bringing equal
          parts menace and equal parts panto character to his role.

          <em>The Nativity Story</em> starts with a title crawl containing
          <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023#en-NIV-19490"
            >Jeremiah 23 5:6</a
          >. Fun stuff. This is pretty immediately followed by shots of Roman
          soldiers running around Nazareth killing young boys in case they are
          the prophecy-filling messiah. Not quite

            >Jingle All the Way</a

        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose if you wanted to educate young &#39;uns on the real story
          behind Christmas, and the depravity surrounding it, this could be a
          fantastic family film. Probably not one to gather round the TV for on
          the 24th though.

          ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ Ooh err. There isn&#39;t really much of a soundtrack, though
          the whole thing ends with a fairly masked version of Silent Night so
          we can give a single star here!

          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ<br />I really enjoyed this film. It&#39;s <em>very</em> well
          produced and, although predictable, tells the story with a unusually
          serious tone. Imagine if your pre-school&#39;s nativity play was
          directed by David Fincher; that&#39;s kind of what you have here.
