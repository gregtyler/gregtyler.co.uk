          I&#8217;ll come back to Sarah&#8217;s thread throughout this post, but
          it&#8217;s well worth a read and takes a different angle to what
          I&#8217;m about to say. My main talking point from it is that
          incremental refactoring is essential to a healthly project, and we
          don&#8217;t need to make massive changes all the time. But she also
          talks excellently on analysis and communication.

            To actually fix it, you need to negotiate with the individuals who
            are applying the pressure [to not refactor]. You need to understand
            THEIR incentives, and align your desired changes with those.

        <h2>Bad code</h2>

        <p>
          Like many (most?) developers, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time with
          &#8220;bad code&#8221;, most of which I&#8217;ve written myself. This
          is code that I know to not be high quality, and that I understand
          needs to be refactored. But I want to identify first what makes code
          &#8220;bad&#8221; and why we put up with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          There&#8217;s a category of bad code which is just poorly written,
          perhaps because of laziness or lack of skill. But that&#8217;s a tiny
          proportion of most of the code I&#8217;ve ever refactored. In my
          experience, most bad code was fine when it was originally written but
          has since turned sour, for a variety of reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Perhaps <strong>best practices has moved on</strong> and what
            <em>was</em> best practice is now bad practice
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps <strong>the scope has changed</strong> and what was a small
            throwaway feature has become a fundamental part of an application
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps
            <strong>you originally made a rough proof-of-concept</strong> and
            it&#8217;s been blindly embedded into a real-world application
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps <strong>dependencies have been upgraded</strong> and
            you&#8217;re using a package which is missing key features or,
            worse, isn&#8217;t being supported
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps
            <strong>you&#8217;ve found a better way of doing things</strong> and
            you&#8217;re suddenly aware that the code could be faster, smaller
            or more pure
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps <strong>your code has become insecure</strong> due to a
            vulnerability being discovered, or processing power evolving to make
            brute force attacks possible
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All of these circumstances can be mitigated slightly with good
          preparation, but I think it&#8217;s naive to think of them as
          completely avoidable. Writing web applications is a constant stream of
          being blindsided by technology, market trends and user needs. So, at
          some point, your code will become bad and need to be refactored.
        </p>

        <h2>Recent experiences</h2>

        <p>
          I want to talk a bit about my experience lately and where I believe I
          went wrong. Then I&#8217;ll talk a bit about what I&#8217;ve learnt
          from the experience and what I&#8217;ll do to avoid it happening again
          on my next project.
        </p>

        <p>
          About six months ago I picked up a new front-end project, based on
          React and Redux. The project was started a couple of years back, and
          has been intermittently worked on since, but I believe I was the first
          developer to really start looking at it on a day-to-day basis with the
          vision to release it to customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you&#8217;re already seeing the red flags, then you did a better
          job than me. I picked up the project, got a feel for how it worked,
          and started implementing new features. Refactoring didn&#8217;t really
          cross my mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I missed was that the project was littered with bad code. And let
          me clarify again that this wasn&#8217;t because of anyone who worked
          on it previously, it was because:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The project had been started two years ago</li>
          <li>It had only been worked on intermittently</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Two years had been a long time for the React ecosystem, and best
          practices had moved on significantly. The project had been started
          from a popular-at-the-time template which structured code and used
          packages in a way that is now discouraged (I tracked down the original
          template, which explains it is now deprecated and not recommended).
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the course of two years, work hadn&#8217;t been properly planned
          or scheduled (the application was effectively a prototype during this
          time) so new features were introduced sporadically and inconsistently.
          With the time constraints this is excusable, but it left the
          application fragmented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, coming into the project in mid-2018, the code was
          inconsistent and didn&#8217;t match any reference sources online
          (since documentation is updated to reflect current best practies) and
          a lot of the dependencies were out-of-date. Some of those dependencies
          could be upgraded quite easily, but some (for example, upgrading React
          Router from version 2 to 4) required complete code changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>

        <p>
          A little while into the project I started to appreciate the scale of
          refactoring required and quickly pushed the thought from my mind
          because it was &#8220;too big&#8221;. I had features to implement,
          deadlines to meet, and I didn&#8217;t have time to rewrite data
          architecture (a scarily impactful change!).
        </p>

        <p>
          But reality shortly set in. Some features <em>required</em> packages
          to be upgraded, and documenting a system which mixed old and new
          techniques was becoming a nightmare. I started to pick a few battles
          and refactor the application as-and-when I came to problem areas. In
          effect, I was starting to read the advice I saw from Sarah today:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
          <p>Improvement</p>
          <p>Over</p>
          <p>Consistency.</p>
          <cite
            ><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090875259731890177"
              >Sarah Mei (@sarahmei)</a
            ></cite
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Six months into the project, there&#8217;s been a lot of improvement.
          Our usage of Redux is (mostly) clean and consistent, we&#8217;re
          starting to build up a component library, ESLint is strict and
          passing, and this week our React Router dependency got upgraded to
          version 4.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, there&#8217;s still a lot to do: there&#8217;s some data
          duplication across Redux stores, directory structure is unintuitive
          and there&#8217;s a 2000+ line component that I&#8217;m dreading
          having to tackle.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I see it, incremental improvement to the application was the only
          way to keep this project working. Avoiding these small refactors would
          have led to a slower, harder to develop application; a large refactor
          would have meant throwing out a lot of our good work and delaying the
          project. Instead, we have a <em>functional</em>, <em>better</em> but
          <em>imperfect</em> codebase, happy clients and a good vision for
          future work.
        </p>

        <p>Improvement over consistency.</p>

        <h2>Planning refactoring</h2>

        <p>
          I&#8217;m well aware of the mistakes I made on this project. I
          didn&#8217;t acknowledge the need to refactor quick enough,
          didn&#8217;t communicate this to my colleagues and managers, and
          didn&#8217;t suitably plan how I would perform the refactoring. So, as
          ever, let&#8217;s make this a learning opportunity. What will I do
          differently next time?
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, I&#8217;ll make sure I
          <strong>properly assess bad code</strong> when taking over new
          projects or at regular intervals when working on my own. There&#8217;s
          no shame in acknowledging that code falls out-of-date and identifying
          where improvements can be made.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, I&#8217;ll be careful in this process not to over-estimate
          the bad code. It&#8217;s easy to get carried away and insist on making
          sweeping changes which won&#8217;t actually help (e.g. migrating to
          the hottest new tool when your existing one works and is actively
          supported).
        </p>

        <p>
          Assessing the bad code will also involve
          <strong>writing a report</strong> about my findings. I&#8217;ll
          identify the <em>isolated</em> areas of the code which need to be
          refactored, make suggestions about how they can be improved, and
          provide options for how that might be approached.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ll <strong>share the report with colleagues</strong> to raise
          awareness of the problems and indicate what additional work might need
          to be prioritised. They may be able to suggest solutions they&#8217;ve
          adopted in the past, or identify other projects which could benefit
          from the same refactoring.
        </p>

        <p>
          Doing this proper analysis and report writing will ensure that
          I&#8217;m aware of the refactoring opportunities, and can properly
          plan for how to enact them. When I have capacity, or am working in a
          related area, I can refer to my report to pick up the additional
          refactoring work without having to do all the analysis again.
        </p>

        <h2>Communicating refactoring</h2>

        <p>
          Finally, I wanted to end with a brief note about how to ensure that
          you suitably communicate the importance of refactoring. In the
          introduction I suggested that refactoring involves rewriting
          &#8220;functional code&#8221; (which isn&#8217;t high quality), and
          people can often balk at this idea: if the code is functional, why
          waste our time rewriting it when we have other things to work on?
        </p>

        <p>Again, Sarah&#8217;s Twitter thread covers this very well.</p>

        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
          <p>
            There’s almost always a win-win in there SOMEWHERE. You can start by
            trying to understand what is driving that desire for them. It might
            not be what you think.
          </p>
          <cite
            ><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090888376926892033"
              >Sarah Mei (@sarahmei)</a
            ></cite
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Refactoring will often bring tangible improvements: faster, smaller,
          fewer errors, looks nicer. If these match with your
          colleague&#8217;s/manager&#8217;s/company&#8217;s priorities, then you
          have a great opportunity to sell the benefits and get buy-in.
        </p>

        <p>
          But some refactoring isn&#8217;t like that. It can have other reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Using an old version of a depedency may <em>work</em> but it
            won&#8217;t be supported if something goes wrong
          </li>
          <li>Outdated or complex code is hard for new starts to understand</li>
          <li>Old technology is battle-tested, but hard to recruit for</li>
          <li>
            Inconsistent code is confusing, and damages developers&#8217;
            cognitive load
          </li>
          <li>Complex code may work, but it&#8217;s fragile</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Importantly, all of these reasons to refactor can save time and money
          in the future because they allow you to mitigate against anticipated
          problems. So whilst code might not be causing you problems
          <em>right now</em>, spending a few hours to refactor something today
          might save you five days, apologetic emails and wasted money in six
          months time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, when agitating for refactoring, you need to make sure you
          know <em>why</em> it&#8217;s a good idea, and that you can sell that
          to your team. Identify the reasons, calculate the impact, and explain
          your strategy to mitigate.
        </p>
