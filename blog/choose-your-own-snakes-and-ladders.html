  I was in an exercise at work recently which involved visualising our
  last two weeks as a game of snakes and ladders: we drew a game board
  and labelled the ladders with things that had helped us progress, the
  snakes were things that hindered. (Sound like a good idea?

    >We&#8217;re hiring!</a

</p>

<p>
  During this exercise I had a minor, irrelevant realization that the
  game of Snakes and Ladders was simply a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine"
    >finite-state machine</a
  >
  with randomly-selected transitions. If you&#8217;re on square 17, you
  will always go to square 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23 if you roll a 1, 2,
  3, 4, 5 or 6 respectively. If you land on a square with a snake or
  ladder, you instantly transition to its other end.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;d also been thinking recently about how Choose Your Own
  Adventure books (which are apparently properly called &#8220;<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook"
    >gamebooks</a
  >&#8220;) are <em>also</em> finite-state machines. From any one page
  in the gamebook, your transition options are finite and clearly
  defined.
</p>

<p>
  Neither of these are particularly insightful observations,
  they&#8217;re just different ways of thinking about representation and
  codification. When you work with software, you think about this a lot
  (I&#8217;ve also been thinking about how to codify recipes recently).
</p>

<p>
  The upshot of this is that I created a Choose Your Own Adventure style
  <a href="https://lovely-serpent.glitch.me/"
    ><strong>Snakes and Ladders game</strong></a
  >. It&#8217;s predictable, repetitive and relies completely on chance
  (as the original). I also think it&#8217;s strangely charming and
  I&#8217;d like to publish a physical copy sometimeâ€”I just need some
  cover art.
