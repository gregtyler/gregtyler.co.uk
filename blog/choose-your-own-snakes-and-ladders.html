          I was in an exercise at work recently which involved visualising our
          last two weeks as a game of snakes and ladders: we drew a game board
          and labelled the ladders with things that had helped us progress, the
          snakes were things that hindered. (Sound like a good idea?
          <a href="https://jobs.jobvite.com/justicedigitalandtechnology"
            >We&#8217;re hiring!</a
          >)
        </p>

        <p>
          During this exercise I had a minor, irrelevant realization that the
          game of Snakes and Ladders was simply a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine"
            >finite-state machine</a
          >
          with randomly-selected transitions. If you&#8217;re on square 17, you
          will always go to square 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23 if you roll a 1, 2,
          3, 4, 5 or 6 respectively. If you land on a square with a snake or
          ladder, you instantly transition to its other end.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;d also been thinking recently about how Choose Your Own
          Adventure books (which are apparently properly called &#8220;<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook"
            >gamebooks</a
          >&#8220;) are <em>also</em> finite-state machines. From any one page
          in the gamebook, your transition options are finite and clearly
          defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          Neither of these are particularly insightful observations,
          they&#8217;re just different ways of thinking about representation and
          codification. When you work with software, you think about this a lot
          (I&#8217;ve also been thinking about how to codify recipes recently).
        </p>

        <p>
          The upshot of this is that I created a Choose Your Own Adventure style
          <a href="https://lovely-serpent.glitch.me/"
            ><strong>Snakes and Ladders game</strong></a
          >. It&#8217;s predictable, repetitive and relies completely on chance
          (as the original). I also think it&#8217;s strangely charming and
          I&#8217;d like to publish a physical copy sometime‚ÄîI just need some
          cover art.
