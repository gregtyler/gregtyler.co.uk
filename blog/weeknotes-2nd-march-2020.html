        <p>This week I wrote controller unit tests</p>

        <p>
          This might not sound like much of an achievement, but it&#8217;s been
          a big gap in our testing coverage.
        </p>

        <p>
          The limiting factor has been how to mock out services: we want to
          ensure the email sender is used, but not actually send it.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few things have made this easier: enabling autowiring, a better
          understanding of Symfony and its configuration options, and a real
          need for these tests.
        </p>

        <p>
          As far as I&#8217;m aware, there&#8217;s now <em>nothing</em> we
          can&#8217;t test. This is great news for our test confidence, but also
          our coverage measurement: if we can cover everything in unit tests, we
          can measure it easily. Up until now we&#8217;ve been limited to
          end-to-end testing, which is hard to measure.
