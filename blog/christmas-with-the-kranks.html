        <h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ Let&#39;s get something straight here from the off: I&#39;m
          on Team Cruise. I don&#39;t think Christmas should be about doing the
          same thing as everyone else, as you do every year. I think we should
          respect those who want to move away from the commercial side of buying
          trees, decorations, presents, large meals etc. This film in fact
          covers a very interesting viewpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, for that reason, I&#39;d rate this high on &quot;Christmas
          spirit&quot;, because our lead couple seem to want to do something
          altogether very Christmassy: spend time together, away from work and
          other distractions. However, the turning point in this film &#8211;
          where their daughter returns and they very suddenly have to get in the
          swing of No√´l &#8211; completely ruins this whole point and throws
          them back to just another pair of drones who succumb to group think.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to say being in a traditional festive spirit is wrong, it&#39;s
          the creepy Orwellian way in which the neighbours enforce it on our
          central characters that throws me. It&#39;s threatening and
          aggressive, and implies that rather than being full of spirit and joy,
          you should mindlessly be involved in traditions because
          <em>that&#39;s what people do here</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and at the end they randomly imply that a minor character
          who&#39;s only popped up in a few scenes is actually the real Santa
          Claus, as his 2CV is pulled in the sky by a herd of reindeer. Sigh.
          You can&#39;t force Christmas.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ It&#39;s a fairly all-star cast for the time. Jamie Lee
          Curtis comes on the back of Freaky Friday, Cheech Marin has just done
          three Spy Kids movies, and Erik Per Sullivan is at the height of
          playing Dewey in <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tim Allen leads and, I must admit, I do like him. I&#39;ve always had
          the impression people have a certain beef with Allen, but he tends to
          do a pretty good job at the lovably dim-witted lead. Galaxy Quest, Toy
          Story, Home Improvements and The Santa Clause (which I watched
          <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-santa-clause/">last year</a
          >) are all solid examples of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The supporting cast is pretty strong too, almost all playing
          stereotypes, but playing them well. One strange exception is Dan
          Akyroyd, whose character is continuously irritating and not fun (for
          the reasons in the section above).
        </p>
        <h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ <em>Christmas with the Kranks</em> has such a weird tone! It
          goes from some childish slapstick of Tim Allen being splashed with a
          puddle of water to (immediately afterwards) Jamie Lee Curtis prepping
          herself for getting laid on the dinner table. Weird. And then
          there&#39;s a whole gag of a priest staring at bikini-clad
          Curtis&#39;s chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          This all cycles back around to the earlier point too: the people
          involved don&#39;t seem to actually want to celebrate Christmas,
          they&#39;re being forced to. And not in a way that&#39;s explored at
          all; they&#39;re completely and unquestionably subservient. This is no
          way to introduce Christmas to children, to provide an expectation that
          they&#39;ll enjoy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a couple of stars must be left in for slapstick comedy and a
          few witty bits of dialogue. I can&#39;t be too crushing on day two,
          after all.
        </p>
        <h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ A load of carols show up in this, both as part of the
          soundtrack and being sang by a choir. The soundtrack ones play well,
          doing the absolutely correct job of adding an overtone throughout the
          movie. There&#39;s also a welcome appearance of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2u0BvyDxdM"
            >Holiday on Strings</a
          >, which I&#39;ve never previously considered a festive piece but
          probably will from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for those aforementioned carol singers, they very aggressively sing
          at the Kranks whilst surrounding their house which starts as a cheap
          laugh (the whole cast seem to appear) but quickly falls into the
          sinister and downright creepy tone that this film rides on for its
          middle third.
        </p>
        <h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
        <p>
          ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ<br />A promising start, offering a break from the norm, but
          it quickly falls into a menacing and aggressive plot that proves, no
          matter how individual you might you are, you should always just
          conform at your own personal expense.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Based on on a book by John Grisham&quot;. It&#39;s not quite
