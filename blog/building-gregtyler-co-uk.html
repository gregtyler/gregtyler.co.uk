          At the start of 2017, I decided to completely rebuild my blog from
          scratch in Node.js. My old blog was hosted on WordPress but over the
          years I&#39;d got tired of the framework&#39;s complexity and speed
          issues, particularly because I didn&#39;t use the majority of the
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to build something that was simple, lean, nicely designed and
          usable on all devices by all viewers. I was also inspired by the work
          Nicol√°s Bevacqua did on
          <a
            href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/two-way-synchronization-for-a-web-app-and-git"
            >Pony Foo</a
          >
          to track his articles through Git and make it easy for anyone to
          suggest edits through GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, I want to go through some of the decisions I made in
          redesigning
          <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/">gregtyler.co.uk</a> and the
          tools I used to do so.
        </p>
        <h2 id="building-a-blog">Building a blog</h2>
        <p>
          Let&#39;s start with the technical bits. This website is written
          bespoke in Node, without even a application framework like Express
          (the notable modules I use are
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a> for Markdown
          parsing, <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> for code
          display, and
          <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">nunjucks</a> for
          templating). Not using an application framework might seem like a
          silly idea and, in general, it probably is. But this project was as
          much about learning how to build a Node application as it was about
          having a new blog, so I used the opportunity to learn properly about
          how Node handles HTTP requests and responses by handling them all
          myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In development I focused on a couple of major goals. One was to ensure
          the site is performant, which not having an application framework
          helps with because I can see everything happening end-to-end between a
          request and response. Another was to build an application that would
          be robust for the future. I&#39;ve got no plans to roll out the
          application (which I&#39;ve called &quot;Palomar&quot;) to any other
          websites, but designed it as if I did intend to. I also designed it to
          be extensible in the future so that adding new features won&#39;t
          require rewriting the whole application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application is hosted on
          <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, which is new
          for me. I switched from my old host because I was having performance
          issues, bad customer support and paying too much. So far DigitalOcean
          has been cheaper, faster and, whilst I haven&#39;t had to experience
          customer support yet, I&#39;ve been impressed by the wealth of
          <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials"
            >tutorials</a
          >
          on their site documenting how to install and manage all sort of
          software on their servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the server, I use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> as a
          server and, thanks to
          <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a>, I&#39;m
          using HTTPS everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might wonder what database I&#39;m using, and be surprised to find
          that I&#39;m not. See
          <a href="#blogging-with-git">Blogging with Git</a> below to find out
          more.
        </p>
        <h1 id="designing-a-blog">Designing a blog</h1>
        <p>
          Anyone who visited my old blog will be familiar with the new design.
          The colour scheme, fonts and general layout are all very familiar, and
          I&#39;m continuing to use &quot;card&quot; structures on the home
          page.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a couple of significant changes. One is that every post has
          a &quot;series&quot;. These work similar to categories in other
          blogging platforms, except that every post only gets one, and it&#39;s
          used to determine where the post is stored in the Git repository.
          I&#39;m not sure this is the best idea, but so far it&#39;s working
          out quite well as a way to section off particular kinds of content
          (friends may not interested in my
          <a href="/webdev">Web development</a>, colleagues might not want to
          read about <a href="/christmas-2014">Christmas films</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another big change is the addition of &quot;linked articles&quot;.
          These display alongside normal articles on index and archive pages,
          but are actually links out to articles I&#39;ve written on other
          sites. This means that my blog is now the index page for
          <em>everything</em> I write online rather than just the things
          I&#39;ve written here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS for the site is quite simple. There&#39;s
          <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/main.css">one CSS file</a>,
          which uses no frameworks and sits at a tidy 1.9KB. I&#39;ve used the
          patterns of
          <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/">BEM</a> and
          <a href="http://itcss.io/">ITCSS</a>, mostly inspired by the work of
          <a href="https://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> and
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/@shaunbent/css-at-bbc-sport-part-1-bab546184e66"
            >BBC Sport</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&#39;s only one JavaScript file and that&#39;s Google Analytics,
          which I&#39;m planning to remove for something more ethical.
        </p>
        <h1 id="blogging-with-git">Blogging with Git</h1>
        <p>
          By far the biggest decision in this development was moving all of the
          blog writing to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Git is a
          version control system, which means it keeps track of all of the
          changes ever made to a bunch of files, can give detailed history of
          each and restore to any point in time. It&#39;s a much more involved,
          powerful version of track changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of having Git support writing should be obvious, but the
          implementation of doing so certainly is slightly involved. I have a
          <a href="https://github.com/gregtyler/gregtyler-pichon"
            >repository of all of my articles</a
          >
          which is mirrored on the blog server. The application then uses its
          copy of the files to render and display pages as they are requested.
          This means that changes can be made either on my computer, or on
          GitHub, and then need to be pushed onto the server before they are
          live.
        </p>
        <p>
          As explained in the
          <a
            href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/two-way-synchronization-for-a-web-app-and-git"
            >article from Nicol√°s Bevacqua</a
          >, a key benefit of this is that readers can identify mistakes or
          improvements and fix them themselves in GitHub. It also means that,
          when not at home, I can write drafts and articles through GitHub&#39;s
          interface rather than on my computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          One regret I have about the current set-up that I would like to change
          is that it relies on a push to the application server. In the future,
          I&#39;d like the server to automatically take any new updates directly
          from GitHub without needing a push. This would enable to handle my
          entire editing and publishing process through GitHub rather than
          needing my PC to actually put the new posts on the server.
        </p>

          There&#39;s clearly more work to be done on
          <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/">gregtyler.co.uk</a>, but
          I&#39;m extremely happy with the results so far.
