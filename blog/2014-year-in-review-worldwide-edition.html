          I&#39;ve written my annual
          <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/2014-year-in-review/"
            >personal Year in Review</a
          >, but this year I wanted to touch upon some issues that haven&#39;t
          necessarily affected me or my work directly, but have nonetheless
          affected my year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m not a professional writer, journalist, nor political pundit.
          These vague views are just what I&#39;ve come to feel at the end of
          the year. Take them all at face value, and feel free to point out if
          anything is erroneous.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don&#39;t like to lead with a negative tone but, from a global
          perspective, 2014 has really sucked. Simple mentions of words like
          &quot;Ebola&quot;, &quot;Ukraine&quot; and &quot;Ferguson&quot; bring
          to mind grave and complex stories from the past 12 months. Even our
          two great sporting events of the year have been overshadowed. Both the
          World Cup and the Winter Olympics were supposed to be great
          opportunities to connect with two countries which are on the up, but
          the first was marred by controversies in a now overtly corrupt FIFA
          and the second by Russian homophobia and land invasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closer to heart, the previously escapist hobby of playing video games
          was over-run by often misappropriated &quot;controversies&quot; which
          dominated gaming discussion and press. What was previously a place of
          openness was turned into a hotbed for harassment and misogyny, and
          endless condemnations of the selfsame harassment and misogyny. An
          entire culture was spoiled, not by GamerGate and not by
          &quot;SJWs&quot;, but by constant bickering and fighting to stay
          relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, to my mind, this has all been the fault of poor
          reactionary journalism, an unintelligible thirst for controversial
          stories which bring in more readers, more viewers and more money.
          Online journalism has succumbed to the syndrome of Buzzfeed and
          Upworthy, trying to reshape itself to align with their profitable
          models, riding the curtails of the young audience they pick up, and
          damned to the fact that this isn&#39;t news any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, I want to see a return to traditional news-telling. I want to
          see stories researched and confirmed properly before being put online,
          with a weak apology issued the next day stating how it was an
          &quot;editorial oversight&quot; which inadvertently earned thousands
          of pounds of revenue in advertising money that shan&#39;t be repaid. I
          want to see the news not trying to be relevant and hip, to stop
          pandering to people by covering inconsequential stories on topics like
          Minecraft and &quot;James from Vine&quot; in an attempt to corral
          people to start visiting their site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;d like to see more grass-roots journalism, more explanations
          from the field which aren&#39;t over-blown reports composed by someone
          thousands of miles away who has a frame in mind for the story already.
          I finally see the point of something like the upcoming
          <a href="http://www.infobitt.com/">Infobitt</a> which, whilst not
          looking perfect, seems to be a step in the right direction. And I want
          to see the general public holding the news reporting outlets honest,
          challenging bad and unethical practices. Why are resources like
          Private Eye to be the only ones to report on, for example, favourable
          coverage based on business deals?
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years (and undoubtedly for longer since) online
          journalism has turned from being informative to being crass
          entertainment. Too much time is spent pushing agendas, attacking
          groups with whom the writer disagrees, and with whom they think their
          readership should disagree with too. And too often this descends into
          little more than personal attacks, manufactured outrage, and an
          altogether false reality that exists only to help validate previously
          held beliefs.
        </p>
        <hr />

          It&#39;s been a funny year for politics too. In declaring their
          outrage at the ever-growing UKIP, the press helped propel them even
          further up the pecking order. We may look back at say that UKIP have
          gained such much traction this year because of their strong results in
          the
          <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)"
            >European elections</a
          >
          but, frankly, they gained traction because every left-wing media
          outlet spent months beforehand issuing front-page headlines that only
          bolstered their following.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to contradict my point and further draw attention to UKIP, but I
          get where their following is coming from. Despite believing that Nigel
          Farage is a nasty piece of work and his party will do nothing but
          drive our country back in unexpected and turbulent ways, I have to
          credit them with stepping in at a time when people are disillusioned
          and provide a fairly believable alternative. I
          <em>like</em> Farage&#39;s image. He&#39;s not an Oxbridge-educated
          tosspot, but someone who seems (somewhat uniquely in the field) like a
          genuine human being. He seems more interested in talking his mind than
          protecting his image which, even though I agree with his mind, I want
          to see more of in the political world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only other vaguely affable person in politics this year has been
          Russell Brand who can certainly be credited with getting younger
          people interested in the field, but with little more. Brand talks with
          long words and archaic language, presumably to appear intelligent, but
          instead comes across like a pantomime character from the 1800s.
        </p>
        <p>
          With both Farage and Brand, I completely see where they come from and
          why they&#39;re needed in the spectrum right now. I want more
          accessible politicians in our country, I just wish they were more
          agreeable. Perhaps next year we&#39;ll see the appearance of some
          people who fit into both categories, who can be genial, intelligent
          and hold an argument without shouting or falling back to insults.
          I&#39;d really like to be able to vote for someone I
          <em>genuinely believe in</em> in an upcoming election.
