        <p>This week I started shifting to a new team.</p>

        <p>
          So the big news for me this week is that we&#8217;re making a new team
          at OPG which I&#8217;m going to be a developer on.
        </p>

        <p>
          We&#8217;ll be focusing on better supporting colleagues working from
          home, and modernising a central system (with exciting words like React
          and Micro frontend).
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ll write more about this as we get into it over the coming
          weeks but it&#8217;s following on well from research/planning work
          I&#8217;ve been doing with JN and I&#8217;m excited to go back to
          frontend development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whilst the team engine is still being built, I&#8217;m working on
          finishing up work on Complete the deputy report. We&#8217;ve been good
          at communicating and documenting, so this isn&#8217;t a big handover
          situation; I just want to see off what I&#8217;m working on.
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of that this week has been page headings. Bit of a snooze fest
          for most but our headings are rubbish and unclear, particularly for
          screen reader users. I&#8217;ve been simplifying them, aligned with
          GDS standards, and making sure they look the same visually and
          semantically.
        </p>

        <p>
          It&#8217;s not glamorous work, but it&#8217;s good work dammit. And
          it&#8217;s been bugging me since I started on this service a year ago,
          so nice to fix before I move on to new things.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed as many headings as possible</li>
          <li>A bunch of releases and code reviews</li>
          <li>Ongoing work with integrations and simplifying our database</li>
          <li>Started to think/talk about new team goals and delivery</li>
