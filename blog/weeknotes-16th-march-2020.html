        <p>
          We started a new sprint this week, and it came with a lot of
          carry-over (as is sometimes the case, nobody&#8217;s perfect).
          That&#8217;s led to picking our battles a bit more wisely, since we
          don&#8217;t want to increase the ticket queue. As such, I started the
          sprint with a bunch of technical upgrades and debt payoff.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few more interesting tickets remain though. For one, we had a
          security incident over the weekend which I helped deal with on Monday.
          In the spirit of transparency you can
          <a
            href="https://opgtransform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DigiDeps/pages/1422098446/16+March+2020+Access+control+incident"
            >read the details of our investigation online</a
          >. It turned out to be (some level of) user error, but we&#8217;re
          putting additional safeguards in place to protect against similar
          issues in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also spent more time on our ever encompassing integration. AE and AS
          have done some amazing work at writing isolated, loosely coupled code
          and I helped look at some of the contract testing which is going
          exactly where we want it to.
        </p>

        <p>
          On my own end, I updated the admin UI to show information about how
          the integration is performing. It was one of those satisfying bits of
          work that touches every part of our service in one small way.
          Hopefully next week we&#8217;ll have the bulk of the integration done
          and can just do tweaks to finish it off.
        </p>

        <h2>Isolation, quarantine and what that means for DigiDeps</h2>

        <p>
          I work in a distributed team, based across sites in Birmingham and
          Nottingham. We often work from home, some of us moreso than in the
          office. As such, the switch to home working has been fairly
          straightforward so far.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tuesday was our first all-remote retrospective/planning and I think it
          went great. We&#8217;re still figuring out how to transfer our
          in-person practices to digital (particularly voting and anonymish
          sticky notes), but I reckon we got a good 90% of value out of that
          session.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of next week though, we&#8217;ll have to contend with children.
          Most of the team have kids in the house now and will be acting
          primarily as carers. There&#8217;s no doubt this will affect our
          output/velocity/other business-y words.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that&#8217;s fine, right? Most of the changes to our service
          aren&#8217;t more important than raising a child safely and securely.
          And any that are can easily get done by skeleton staff. The
          &#8220;nice to have&#8221;s can be pushed back without mercy, whilst
          we wait for this situation to stabilise a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
          So my view (as not a delivery manager, not a senior dev, not a line
          manager, just an observer) is that we intentionally ramp down a little
          bit and manage our prioritisation more closely. We should focus on the
          things that <em>need</em> to happen first, then work on the more
          important bits, but be happy to let things slip.
        </p>

        <p>I reckon that looks something like:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Keep the live service running</li>
          <li>Be available to other teams who need support</li>
          <li>Work on high priority tickets</li>
          <li>Improve resilience/reduce cost</li>
          <li>Work on low priority tickets</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          That&#8217;s a start. We need to identify external expectations and
          how things should be prioritised, but I think we need to be realistic,
          pragmatic and flexible in these challenging times.
        </p>
