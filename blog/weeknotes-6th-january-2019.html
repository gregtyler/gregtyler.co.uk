          This week I wrote my first
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ve always thought of Lambda&#8217;s as one of
          <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS&#8217;s</abbr> signature
          features. It&#8217;s one of the first I heard about and it really
          exemplifies what makes AWS differ from a traditional virtual hosting
          provider. Admittedly it&#8217;s not really a unique feature any more
          (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"
            >Azure</a
          >
          and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/">GCP</a> have
          their own alternatives), but it was an eye-opener to me when I first
          heard about the modern public cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the uninitiated, Lambdas/Functions are simple scripts which are
          run on-demand and you&#8217;re only charged for the execution time.
          They&#8217;re perfect for uncommon, intensive tasks so you can
          effectively pop open a server for 30 seconds every few hours as
          needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Anyway</em>, I&#8217;ve never written one and we haven&#8217;t
          used them in any products I&#8217;ve worked on. That is, until this
          week, when I&#8217;ve written a very simple Lambda to restart one of
          our services on a semi-regular basis (which sounds as iffy as it is,
          but is due to reliance on a third-party image).
        </p>

        <p>
          This has slightly been a rite of passage, and a good thing to cross
          off my personal development list, but it also indicates a growing
          confidence with cloud hosting and ability to just muck in with such
          things. Very exciting indeed.

        <p>
          We&#8217;re in the post-winter-break period now, in which everyone can
          freely shrug off responsibility for two weeks by saying they&#8217;re
          still getting into the swing of it. That might sound critical, but I
          genuinely like that we can all pick our own pace right now. It&#8217;s
          famously a bad time of the year for mental and physical health, and
          being able to pair that with a little self-care in your workload is
          really powerful.
        </p>

        <p>
          My team has taken what I think is a very reasonable approach to our
          first sprint of the year: we&#8217;re fixing a bunch of bugs and
          &#8220;the basics&#8221; to make sure we&#8217;re in a good place to
          support our service and introduce bigger features. We&#8217;re also
          having a session next week to redefine what the service does, so we
          can better prioritise and align our work. Hopefully by the end of the
          month we&#8217;ll be designing and building high-quality unblocked
          work that&#8217;s really helpful to our users.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Unblocked the pipeline: some of our automated tests relied on
            referring to the current calendar year, which has recently changed.
            I made them more flexible rather than just updating the year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upgraded our PDF generator: we had a minor failure over the winter
            break, so I brought the generator back under our control and
            upgraded all the dependencies/OS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed the stability of our virus scanner: this was having trouble
            restarting smoothly, so I used a Lambda and some improved ECS
            configuration to make it more stable.
          </li>
          <li>Started adding user management to Serve OPG</li>
          <li>
            Planned some goals and personal development opportunities for 2020
          </li>
          <li>
            Fought off a cold (though it&#8217;s having a late resurgence
            &#x1f641;)
          </li>
