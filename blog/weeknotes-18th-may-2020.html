        <p>This week I moved house.</p>

        <p>
          And, honestly, that took up a lot of my time and most of my mental
          energy. I still got some work done, but it was a slow burn.
        </p>

        <p>
          To highlight a good thing though: we had a team meeting on Thursday to
          realign our integration work. It was a really positive meeting where I
          felt we got complete control of the work ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          More importantly though, it was nice to have a meeting with everyone
          on the same page: we all know what&#8217;s happening, what decisions
          need to be made and what the impact of work is.
        </p>

        <p>
          That could just be a bit of new-team positivity, but I think
          it&#8217;s also because of our focus work stream. We&#8217;re fixing a
          few bugs and preparing other work, but at least 75% of our effort is
          on one clear task.

          <li>
            Fixed a bug that&#8217;s been sitting around for a few years (a
            benefit of having a dedicated team on this service!)
          </li>
          <li>Added error handling to our publishing process</li>
          <li>
