        <p>(Last week I created a Pact file, but missed weeknotes).</p>

        <p>This week I started moving some big changes forwad.</p>

        <p>
          In Complete the deputy report, we have a few big changes in the
          pipeline. I&#8217;ve discussed before that having multiple significant
          strands at once isn&#8217;t my preferred approach, but here we are in
          the real world where things can&#8217;t move at the pace I&#8217;d
          like.
        </p>

        <p>
          This week I&#8217;ve worked on a range of stories that set the
          groundwork for these big changes: moving more emails to GOV.UK Notify,
          creating a new permissions structure for administrators, rewriting
          tests in a standalone format, and making changes to database tables
          which will be necessary for our upcoming integrations.
        </p>

        <p>
          That means the next few weeks will be chasing down the middle or tail
          ends of these projects: deprecating our old email service, redesigning
          the admin portal, rewriting more tests, and building an integration.
          Hopefully not too simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h2>Making a Pact</h2>

        <p><em>The update that I would have written last week.</em></p>

        <p>
          I spent a lot of the week working with
          <a href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</a> and planning how we might
          integrate it into our projects and workflows. Pact is a kind of
          all-in-one contract testing tool, which provides mocking for
          contracted services and keeps track of tests to ensure their contract
          (or &#8220;pact&#8221;) is being met.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a consumer (consumer = app using API) perspective you write out
          some expectations of how API requests should go (pseudocode follows):
        </p>

        <pre
          class="wp-block-code"
        ><code><span class="hljs-selector-tag">pact</span>
  <span class="hljs-selector-class">.onRequest</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'/users'</span>)
  <span class="hljs-selector-class">.willReturn</span>(arrayOf(objectWith(
    <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>: /[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>-<span class="hljs-number">9</span>]+/,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">username</span>: /[a-z0-<span class="hljs-number">9</span>-_]{<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-number">16</span>}
  ))
  .suchAs([
    { <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-attribute">username</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'toddsmith'</span> },
    { <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">353953</span>, <span class="hljs-attribute">username</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'lithiumrogue'</span> },
  ]);</code></pre>

        <p>
          Pact then runs a mock server with these responses baked in, and you
          can run unit tests against code which calls it:
        </p>

        <pre
          class="wp-block-code"
        ><code>const<span class="hljs-built_in"> users </span>= api.getUsers();

expect(users).toHaveLength(2);
expect(users[0].id).toBe(4);

pact.verify();</code></pre>

        <p>
          This way you ensure that you&#8217;re code is making API requests as
          anticipated, and handling the response correctly, alongside your
          existing unit tests.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of the tests, Pact generates a JSON file containing all of
          your expectations (so a more formal and language-independent version
          of my pseudocode above) to provide a concrete document of how the
          consumer expects the API to behave.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, there&#8217;s a tool call
          <a href="https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker">Pact Broker</a> which
          collates these JSON files and tests them against the API (in a test
          environment). This completes the validation of the end-to-end service,
          with each end being tested independently and without developers
          needing to both services.
        </p>

        <p>
          This may seem like a lot of effort for minimal gain (I suggest, as
          someone who&#8217;s spent a week grappling with this), but it should
          shine when we have multiple APIs, consumers and endpoints. We could
          have a large number of consumer apps, all using different parts of the
          API and producing Pact JSON files for the bits they need. Then the
          Broker checks <em>all</em> of these automatically and provides
          realtime feedback about the overall health of our (and our
          associates&#8217;) services.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#8217;m sure this is just the start of our Pact journey,
          particularly because our scale is currently miniscule (one API, one
          consumer, two endpoints). Hopefully I&#8217;ll post an update in a few
          months to see how it&#8217;s going.
        </p>

            YouTube, partly to explore some APIs)
