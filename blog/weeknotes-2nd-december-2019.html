        This week I handled handover. One of our five developers left this week,
        and another is going in a couple of weeks. Nothing nefarious, just the
        end of their contracts. Whilst we&#8217;re in the midst of recruitment
        to fill their boots, we&#8217;re also ensuring everything is handed
        over: not just work and knowledge but also permissions and
        responsibilities. Losing staff is always sad, and always a risk. These
        two have been excellent colleagues and in part that&#8217;s been clear
        by how easy handover had been. Rather than everything being left to the
        last minute, we&#8217;ve spent months planning and preparing for this.
        It reminds me of an axiom that I believe is credited to Netflix: that
        every developer is responsible for making themselves redundant. That
        plan a bit singularity-enticing, but I&#8217;ve always found it&#8217;s
        good to work as if you&#8217;re leaving next week. It leads to good
        practice in general and makes you much easier to work with.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Fully implemented autowiring. We&#8217;re seeing some of the
            benefits of how this works already.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensured succession of our departing WebOps colleague by engaging
            with the WebOps Community of Practice
          </li>
          <li>More bug fixes based on alarms</li>
          <li>
            Prepared for automation of switching organisations&#8217; ACLs:
            we&#8217;ve been doing this manually so far, but hope to big bang
            all the easy ones next week
          </li>
          <li>
            A bunch of risk analysis, ticket planning etc. in preparation for
            being a smaller team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Read Richard Pope&#8217;s fantastic playbook for
            <a href="https://t.co/hJulEzhMcT?amp=1">Government as a Platform</a>
            (YMMV, but this is exactly my jam right now)
