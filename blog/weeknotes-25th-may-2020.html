        <p>This week I wrote some letters.</p>

        <p>
          But not any old letters! We&#8217;re putting some serious work into
          the letters sent to donors and attorneys when they register a new LPA.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new letters will provide more detail on the rights and
          responsibilities of each actor and provide information on how to use
          their LPA online when contacting banks and similar.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is quite a big deal, and a big change, which was unanticipated
          when we started this work (we thought we were just adding a
          paragraph).
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of the large impact of the work (it&#8217;ll reach tens of
          thousands of people) and associated risks (I really don&#8217;t want
          to be part of a &#8220;government sends incorrect letter&#8221; news
          article) we&#8217;re doing a few things:
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, we&#8217;ve split the work down into smaller chunks. Rather
          than a complete rewrite, we&#8217;re starting with just the &#8220;use
          it online&#8221; info. We&#8217;ll slowly add more content as
          we&#8217;re comfortable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly, we&#8217;re keeping the old letters in rotation. This will
          allow us to do a slower rollout with a small group of new registrants
          (an A/B test).
        </p>

        <p>
          Thirdly, we&#8217;re adding tests on the letter content. This will
          ensure the logic still holds as the letters get more complex (e.g. if
          there are multiple attorneys, we include a paragraph noting how they
          should work together).
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, we&#8217;re pushing back on the logic complexity. Complexity
          introduces risk‚Äîparticularly how our code currently works‚Äîso we want
          to balance personalisation with caution. This means since content may
          not apply to a recipient, but we&#8217;d rather that than risk
          <em>not</em> telling them something important.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          Bit if a weird week here: I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking
          about team/squad comms and‚Äîthough I hate to say the words‚Äîhorizon
          scanning.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Added new letters for donor/attorney registration</li>
          <li>Hotfixed a bug caused by a dependency upgrade (eurgh)</li>
          <li>
            Started discussing integrations, and particularly Pact, cross-teams
          </li>
          <li>
            Discussed and started experimenting with how to communicate more
            effectively between squads
          </li>
          <li>Added some detail to our micro-frontend plans</li>
          <li>
            Got more familiar with Laminas, so I can more effectively use it
            when doing backend dev work
          </li>
        </ul>
