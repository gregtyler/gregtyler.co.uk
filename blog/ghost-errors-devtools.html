<p>
  I was recently presented with the following error in Chrome DevTools:
</p>
<pre><code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }</code></pre>
<p>
  Along with this being a very vague error, the link in DevTools that
  typically takes you to the script with the error instead took me to
  the first line of the HTML document where, of course, there&#39;s no
  JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  I did a bit of searching around and found
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4491533/unexpected-token"
    >this Stack Overflow post</a
  >
  which suggests that it&#39;s not a syntax error in my JavaScript
  files, but something that&#39;s being generated or handled elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  To investigate further, I used the &quot;Pause on exceptions&quot;
  feature of DevTools&#39;s Sources tab, which immediately stops
  execution at the point of error, and highlights where in the stack and
  source code it currently is.

  As can be seen in the attached picture, the error was occurring during
  a call jQuery&#39;s <code>parseJSON</code> function from by own
  <code>builder.start</code>. This led me to find that
  <code>builder.start</code> was trying to parse some JSON from a data
  attribute which had been malformed (<code>{supervisor:}</code>).
  Fixing that JSON speedily removed the syntax error.
</p>
<p>
  So if you come across this sort of &quot;ghost&quot; error, it might
  be a problem with your JSON. More importantly, try using DevTool&#39;s
  <a
    href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging#pause-on-exceptions"
    >Pause on exceptions</a
  >
  to try and get to the bottom of it.

<h2 id="other-browsers">Other browsers</h2>
<p>
  After fixing the problem, I recreated it to see how other
  browsers&#39; developer tools would handle it. Internet Explorer fairs
  slightly better than Chrome, at least narrowing down the error to the
  jQuery file. The trace link just takes you to the last line of the
  file though.
</p>
<img
  class="size-full wp-image-1151"
  src="/images/devtools-syntax-error-ie.png"
  alt=""
  width="419"
  height="226"
  srcset="
    /images/devtools-syntax-error-ie.png         419w,
    /images/devtools-syntax-error-ie-300x162.png 300w
  "

<p>
  Firefox is more helpful, noting directly the function in the call
  stack at the time the error occurred and the position in the JSON
  where the parsing failed. The trace link is also much more accurate
  but, because Firefox Developer Tools don&#39;t handle JavaScript files
  very well yet, clicking through to the minified file is only accurate
  to the line.
