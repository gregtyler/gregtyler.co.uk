        <p>This week I unblocked our deployment pipeline.</p>

        <p>
          Unblocking the pipeline wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily be a big highlight
          of my week, but this week we <em>really </em>blocked it and getting
          out of that was a big deal. I&#8217;ll talk about that more below.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also ended up with a queue of changes stuck in the pipeline,
          including bug fixes, so Friday wound up being a ceremonious day of
          finally shipping a boat load of fixes to production that we&#8217;d
          fixed during the week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, blocking our releases for four days wasn&#8217;t
          <em>that</em> big a deal: six months ago we would only release once or
          twice a week, so it shows how far we&#8217;ve come that this was even
          an issue. But I&#8217;m glad to be in a team where we&#8217;re
          striving to get better every day and not falling back on excuses like
          that.
        </p>

        <h2>Pipeline blockage post-mortem</h2>

        <p>
          <em
            >With apologies to readers who don&#8217;t use web development lingo
            for an otherwise horrible subtitle.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to go through what caused our blockage this week, why it was
          particularly bad, how we solved it, and what I&#8217;ve learnt.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have a &#8220;preproduction&#8221; environment that all code is
          deployed to before release. Sometimes we pause a release at this point
          to test something with realistic data (our test environments just have
          a bunch of fake, sanitised data). But because everything has to go
          through preproduction before release, this means all subsequent
          changes get blocked too: until the change we&#8217;re testing is
          approved, nothing can be released.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Monday we made such a call, pausing releases and queuing up a few
          changes until testing was complete. But testing identified serious
          issues and we couldn&#8217;t release with them in place. Initially we
          tried to create a fix and send that into preproduction too, but it was
          more complex than expected and taking too long. Meanwhile, critical
          bugs were stacking up.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Thursday we made the decision to pull the initial change out,
          freeing the pipeline and allowing us to release everything. However,
          this couldn&#8217;t be done automatically because the queue of other
          changes had confused matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, we manually disabled the functionality (by commenting out
          some key lines), but left everything else in place. This meant that
          our final release ultimately looked like a behind-the-scenes refactor,
          and when we reintroduce the change next week (with the bug fixed),
          we&#8217;ll have a really small changeset that&#8217;s easier to
          manage.
        </p>

        <p>
          I came up with a couple of new rules I suggest implementing when
          blocking a deployment pipeline:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Try to make the blocker as small as possible: release
            behind-the-scenes code first and add nice-to-have improvements in a
            subsequent change later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Schedule testing: agree to, for example, block on Monday at 9AM,
            test until midday, and either release or pull out at midday. Make
            sure everyone who&#8217;s needed to contribute to that can subscibe
            to those time scales.
          </li>
        </ul>
