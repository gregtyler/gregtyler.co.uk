  You might be surprised to hear that Pointless has been on television
  since 2009, with Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman steering the
  helm for all that time. Seven years later, it appears in
  Armstrong&#39;s &quot;best known as&quot; lede
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Armstrong"
    >on Wikipedia</a
  >. In that time they&#39;ve had several Christmas specials, and the
  2013 one stands out to me.

    The contestants
  </p>
</div>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>
  The 2013 line-up includes the pairings of: Brookside alums and
  pantomime faves Linda Lusari and Sam Kane; Paul and Barry Chuckle;
  Keith Harris and Orville; and Roy Wood and Santa.
</p>
<p>
  Keith and Orville are a strange combination, seeing as their both the
  same person. You can&#39;t help but feel that that would be a bit of a
  handicap for Britain&#39;s most famous ventriloquist.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, you may not recognise Wood by name, but he&#39;s the
  front-man of Wizzard and responsible for writing their big Christmas
  hit
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoxQ4Ul_DME"
    >I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday</a
  >. It was recognised at the time that most of Wizzard&#39;s creative
  input came from Wood, and perhaps that lone-wolf mentality explains
  his pairing with a Santa impersonator rather than a colleague or
  contempoary.
</p>
<p>
  Santa turns out to be a bit of a pain in the arse. He&#39;s a bit too
  keen to be the centre of attention, and stumbles a bit with ad
  libbing. But he does have
  <a href="http://celebritysantaclaus.co.uk/">his own website</a> which
  it&#39;s worth taking a diversion to investigate. He has a
  <a href="http://celebritysantaclaus.co.uk/santa-wardrobe/"
    >wide wardrobe of outfits</a
  >
  and confusingly serves &quot;London, Manchester, Birmingham,
  [&#8230;], UK, GB&quot;. A bit of rogue SEO perhaps.

  Round 1 provides some musical fun, asking teams to identify performers
  on Band Aid 20. Admittedly this isn&#39;t actually Christmas music,
  but you can&#39;t help but get the song in your head a bit.
</p>

    How many can you name?

</div>
<p>
  There&#39;s also a Christmas song question in the head-to-head, where
  contestants need to unscramble the names of song titles. Other than
  &quot;Blob By Mr&quot;, these are actually quite hard for a celebrity
  episode.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  But where the Christmas music juices really start flowing is after the
  quiz has concluded and it&#39;s revealed that &quot;Roy Wood and his
  band&quot; will be performing &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas
  Everyday&quot; live in the studio. This goes down extremely well with
  contestants and audience alike who dutifully clap and sing along. And
  it&#39;s really nice actually. It feels very fun, positive, and
  seasonal.
</p>
<p>
  Then you suddenly remember that this must be filmed in
  <em>at least</em> September, and it all feels slightly uncomfortable.

  I already mentioned two of the Christmas spirited rounds. Round two
  also had a vague Christmas flavour, asking teams to name countries
  ending in &quot;-an&quot; (the connection being that Santa has to
  visit all the countries of the world). Only 15 answers were available,
  none of them pointless, and it was interesting to see what the most
  obscure were.
</p>
<p>
  Amusingly, this wasn&#39;t a good round for Santa, who played for time
  a lot and complained that they &quot;kept changing their names&quot;.
  I suppose he has been around a good long time.

<p>
  The set was decorated, Christmas jumpers were donned, and sleigh bells
  were available to the hosts. Add the live music, and you&#39;ve got
  quite the Christmas special. But questions on Scooby Doo and football
  did take some of the Christmas shine off, and remind you that
  you&#39;re watching a game show.

<p>
  Aside from a hint by Santa that he might not be exactly what he&#39;s
  cracked up to be, there is nothing at here to offend anyone of any
  age. And being a celebrity special, the questions are all conveniently
  much more accessible. The jokes are lighthearted, with Armstrong and
  Osman their typical, charming selves.

<p>A great Christmas show! Full of classic tropes and festive fun.</p>
