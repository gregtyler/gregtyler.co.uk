        <p>This week I started integrating.</p>

        <p>
          Not on a personal level: it&#8217;s almost been a year and I think
          we&#8217;ve comfortably crossed that line. I&#8217;m talking about
          integrating services Ôòé
        </p>

        <p>
          At the start of the year, we set up an &#8220;Integrations Team&#8221;
          who are responsible for designing and building APIs between our
          services. The (/an) intended benefit is that they don&#8217;t really
          worry about what happens in each service, but just define the contract
          and shared data. This should unblock individual service teams
          developing dependent features.
        </p>

        <p>
          The integrations team is still in early days (it&#8217;s only been a
          few weeks), but things are clipping along at a fair pace.
          They&#8217;ve published a bunch of standards (in the form of ADRs),
          built infrastructure, and provided early drafts of contracts.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, we&#8217;re having to get our skates on in the service
          teams. So I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time this week communicating with
          and through Integrations colleagues, designing new features, and
          worrying about handling edge cases and downtime.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan is that next week we&#8217;ll agree how we&#8217;ll design
          and build <em>our</em> end of the integration, and start building it
          for real next sprint. We&#8217;ll also hook up our healthcheck page to
          the API&#8217;s to ensure the piping works.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I say, things are still nascent for this new way of working, but
          I&#8217;m optimistic about having a centralised team. It should unlock
          us having a common language across services, and moving forward
          together rather than at a product level.
        </p>
