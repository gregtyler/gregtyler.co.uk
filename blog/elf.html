          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ <em>Elf</em> is &#8211; as I see it &#8211; primarily a
          fish-out-of-water comedy, and it&#39;s rather good at that role as we
          see Buddy run havoc around New York City, getting hit by every taxi
          cab in sight. That mood takes up the middle section of the film,
          whilst the beginning and end really settle into the Christmas spirit.
          Mid-range points for this category, as I thought more could&#39;ve
          been made of the festive themes during the centre third.
        </p>

        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Will Ferrell shines in this film, as you&#39;d probably
          imagine. I&#39;m often amazed at Ferrell&#39;s ability to play such
          over-the-top characters but not feel like he&#39;s doing the same role
          every time. The rest of the cast generally all fit well too, with a
          particular mention due to Peter Dinklage as an easily wound-up
          children&#39;s book connoisseur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, with Jon Favreau directing, it features Jon Favreau playing
          an uncomplicated but perfectly passable role.

        <h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ I know others don&#39;t agree with me on this, but
          <em>Elf</em> didn&#39;t give me that tingly family feel. Ultimately,
          I&#39;m not sure how much the youngest of kids would enjoy it, and it
          doesn&#39;t strike me as the sort of film my mum would put up with
          just because the children wanted to watch it. It&#39;s perfectly nice
          though, and accessible for plenty of ages; just doesn&#39;t quite bite
          my criteria of wholesome family goodness.
        </p>
        <h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The soundtrack is perfectly nice, and it ends with a pretty
          solid Christmas carol. However, it doesn&#39;t give these the sort of
          attention required by this entirely arbitrary category.
        </p>
        <h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
        <p>
          ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br /><em>Elf</em> is a fun, silly film with a mostly
          enjoyable plot. Ferrell is excellent, as are other cast members; the
          cinematography is impressive and even the stunt work has had just the
          right treatment. Ultimately, the seasonal criteria rating perhaps
          don&#39;t do this comedy film justice, but that&#39;s just about what
          you expect when the guy behind <em>Iron Man</em> and
          <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em> makes a Christmas film, right?
