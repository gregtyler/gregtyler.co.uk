  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ <em>Elf</em> is &#8211; as I see it &#8211; primarily a
  fish-out-of-water comedy, and it&#39;s rather good at that role as we
  see Buddy run havoc around New York City, getting hit by every taxi
  cab in sight. That mood takes up the middle section of the film,
  whilst the beginning and end really settle into the Christmas spirit.
  Mid-range points for this category, as I thought more could&#39;ve
  been made of the festive themes during the centre third.

  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Will Ferrell shines in this film, as you&#39;d probably
  imagine. I&#39;m often amazed at Ferrell&#39;s ability to play such
  over-the-top characters but not feel like he&#39;s doing the same role
  every time. The rest of the cast generally all fit well too, with a
  particular mention due to Peter Dinklage as an easily wound-up
  children&#39;s book connoisseur.

<p>
  Of course, with Jon Favreau directing, it features Jon Favreau playing
  an uncomplicated but perfectly passable role.

<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ I know others don&#39;t agree with me on this, but
  <em>Elf</em> didn&#39;t give me that tingly family feel. Ultimately,
  I&#39;m not sure how much the youngest of kids would enjoy it, and it
  doesn&#39;t strike me as the sort of film my mum would put up with
  just because the children wanted to watch it. It&#39;s perfectly nice
  though, and accessible for plenty of ages; just doesn&#39;t quite bite
  my criteria of wholesome family goodness.
</p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>
  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The soundtrack is perfectly nice, and it ends with a pretty
  solid Christmas carol. However, it doesn&#39;t give these the sort of
  attention required by this entirely arbitrary category.
</p>

  ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br/>
  <em>Elf</em> is a fun, silly film with a mostly
  enjoyable plot. Ferrell is excellent, as are other cast members; the
  cinematography is impressive and even the stunt work has had just the
  right treatment. Ultimately, the seasonal criteria rating perhaps
  don&#39;t do this comedy film justice, but that&#39;s just about what
  you expect when the guy behind <em>Iron Man</em> and
  <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em> makes a Christmas film, right?

  The camera work with Will Ferrell and the elves is really well done.
  Colour me impressed, Greg Gardiner.
