title: When is a window closable?

<p>
  JavaScript has a function <code>window.close()</code> which, under
  certain circumstances, will close the current window. However
  sometimes you&#39;ll run into an error like:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In this situation, your helpful &quot;close this window&quot; buttons
  don&#39;t work.
</p>
<p>
  We have exactly this in situation in a current project I work on,
  where we ask people to open a link in a new tab so that
  <code>window.close()</code> will take them back out of it.
</p>
<p>
  The problem we had was knowing when <code>window.close()</code> will
  work. If you open a new window with JavaScript (using
  <code>window.open()</code> no less) then it you&#39;re fine. But if
  you right click and open in a new tab, then submit a form, it
  won&#39;t be happy. So when is a window closable?
</p>
<p>
  My first thought was the <code>opener</code> property of
  <code>window</code> which presumably would hint at where the window
  came from and &#8211; hence &#8211; what can close it. So I made a
  table of various difference situations which I experimented with in
  each of the major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE). Find the
  table below and some terminology explained beneath it.

  <strong>Notes:</strong><br/>&quot;Child&quot; means that the user was
  taken straight to a page with a close button on it. &quot;Through
  form&quot; means they were taken to a page which had a form submission
  before the close page. &quot;Through link&quot; means that they were
  taken to a page with a link to the close page.
</p>
<p>
  &quot;(_blank)&quot; means that the window was opened using an
  <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with the
  <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code> attribute. &quot;(JS)&quot;
  means that the window was opened with the
  <code>window.open</code> function. All other examples were
  <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags with no attributes.
</p>
<p>
  The colour of each cell is whether or not it could successfully be
  closed. The text denotes the value of <code>window.opener</code>.
  Where the text is &quot;N&quot;, this value was <code>null</code>,
  where it is &quot;W&quot; it returned a <code>window</code> object.
  Where it is &quot;U&quot;, it returned <code>undefined</code>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Internet Explorer always prompts you to confirm the window closure.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learnt-">What have we learnt?</h2>
<p>
  Firstly, Internet Explorer is noticeably unusual. It returns
  <code>undefined</code> rather than <code>null</code> and then lets you
  close the window no matter what situation you&#39;re in (though with a
  prompt). Secondly, and important for my situation, asking people to
  open a new tab doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ll be able to close it. As soon
  as they follow a link or submit a form, both Firefox and Internet
  Explorer lose control.
</p>
<p>
  In a goal to find some sort of check whether a window is closable, I
  can recommend the following from my results:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>( <span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.opener === <span class="hljs-string">'object'</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.opener <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> Window ) {
<span class="hljs-comment">// We can certainly use window.close</span>
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
<span class="hljs-comment">// We can't be sure window.close will work</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>
  This is (from the experience above) a cross-browser way to be certain
  that <code>window.close</code> will work, without any browser
  sniffing.
</p>
