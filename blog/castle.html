          Some background on the show: <em>Castle</em> is part of the growing
          number of police procedurals in which a police crew have some sort of
          assistant with no investigative experience, but who uses their other
          skills to solve crimes (see also
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mentalist">The Mentalist</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)"
            >Numbers</a
          >
          or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)">Monk</a>).
          In the case of _Castle_, our consultant (the eponymous Richard Castle)
          is a crime author who reverse-engineers stories to make sense of the
          clues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Castle&#39;s</em> real strength is its ability to merge fantasy
          elements into serious crime plots. There have been episodes about
          zombie outbreaks, vampires hunting the streets, spaceships, westerns,
          and just about every other genre you can think of. &quot;Secret
          Santa&quot;, our chosen episode today, starts with the body of a
          large, white-haired man dressed as Santa falling into the middle of
          Central Park.

          decorations](/castle-secret-santa-decorations.jpg &quot;:right
          &quot;Decorations? Yeah, we got decorations.&quot;&quot;)

        <p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
        <p>
          The primary plot of this &#8211; the investigation into the mysterious
          Santa body &#8211; has some wonderful Christmas moments. The victim
          turns out to have committed his life to portraying Santa and bringing
          joy to those around him, helping out his neighbours and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the trail, there&#39;s a trip to Santa School, where we get
          to see a room full of Santas-in-waiting as they pratice their
          ho-ho-hos and belly laughs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secondary story also elicits much festive spirit, with Castle
          being a huge fan of the season and trying to encourage his family and
          friends to enjoy spending time together and celebrating their
          closeness. His decorations are lavish, his childlike-joy palpable, and
          it&#39;s very hard to not be inspired by that.

          Castle&#39;s detective partner Beckett is not so keen on Christmas.
          Effectively playing the role of Scrooge, she knocks back down all
          hints that the body might be that of <em>actual</em> Santa, and
          rebuffs Castle&#39;s offers of spending Christmas Eve with his family.
          But all is not lost as the Christmas Carol parallels go full circle
          and Beckett eventually decides to skip work and spend Christmas with
          her friends rather than behind a desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirit is lost though once they identify their Santa-a-like and
          start the real detective work. Suddenly we fall into the well of
          clues, leads, witness interviews and very un-Christmassy like
          behaviour. I don&#39;t think it can be helped, but it does take the
          edge of the relaxed festive feel.

          &quot;Secret Santa&quot; plays a strong festive music game.
          Reminiscent of
          <em
            >Die Hard_, a plethora of traditional carols and songs are subtly
            woven into the soundtrack. I caught _Let It Snow_, _I Saw Three
            Ships_, _Deck the Halls_, _Good King Wenceslas</em
          >
          and <em>The Holly and the Ivy</em> all in the background of the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of the music is particularly in your face though, which is why I
          compare it to <em>Die Hard</em>. It helps add to the atmosphere of it
          being Christmas without ramming it down your throat, which I&#39;ve
          always thought particularly important.

          I think <em>Castle</em> is a great show through-and-through. It&#39;s
          got serious crime plots, but a wonderful childlike atmosphere through
          its title character and an uninhibited ability to explore wild plot
          devices. I reckon that makes it suitable for a really wide audience
          from teenagers to pensioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s particularly family friendly. I
          mean, it&#39;s about serious crimes. Murders and the like. And this
          episode is no exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, &quot;Secret Santa&quot; is <em>very</em> clear that Father
          Christmas isn&#39;t real, and that attitude always knocks some points
          off in this category.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Castle</em> has a solid core cast, fronted by Nathan Fillion, and
          they all get proper screen time in &quot;Secret Santa&quot;. But with
          no special guests, there&#39;s nothing special about the cast in this
          episode. Disappointing for a show that&#39;s featured an impressive
          field of guest stars over its eight seasons.
        </p>

          Whilst full of Christmas joy on a personal level, &quot;Secret
          Santa&quot; doesn&#39;t quite put in enough effort to make this a true
          Christmas special. It&#39;s got some of the heart, but it wouldn&#39;t
          have you gathering the family around the television. A lot of thought
          has been made to make this fit into the series, so you wouldn&#39;t
          feel out of place binge-watching it in August. That&#39;s fine, and
          quite skilled, but it doesn&#39;t give it the special festive flavour
          that I want to see.
