        These are websites I&#8217;ve worked on, some on my own, some with
        others. More recently I&#8217;ve been working for the University of
        Edinburgh, mainly on sites only accessible to university staff and
        students, so I can&#8217;t link to that work.

        The University&#8217;s course selection website didn&#8217;t appear
        to be aimed enough at students. Path was designed to combat this, by
        providing a website that told students what they needed to know
        about a course, rather than the minutiae that the university stored.

        Working under the
        <a href="http://croftmedia.co.uk/">Croft Media</a> banner, I helped
        design and build a website for a new mathematics school in London,
        led by three of the city&#8217;s main universities. Building from
        scratch, this improved creating an admissions system and an
        administration portal.

        A personal project, I thought that &#8220;Talk like a Pirate
        Day&#8221; was a bit too immature and created the print pun of
        &#8220;Talk like a Poirot Day&#8221;.
