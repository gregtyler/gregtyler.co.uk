      This privacy notice applies to
      <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk">gregtyler.co.uk</a>, all its
      subdomains and additional sites in this network. Those sites are:

    <h2 id="personal-data">Personal data</h2>

    <p>
      We do not collect any personal data on these sites. However, we do
      monitor traffic to individual pages to provide us with analytics data.
      This data helps us identify popular pages and movement of users across
      websites. It is an extremely common practice, and not used to monitor
      individual users.
    </p>

    <p>
      When tracking your access to these sites, we only store the first two
      parts of your IP address. (e.g. for the IP address
      <code>123.456.789.123</code> we would store <code>123.456.x.x</code>).
      This means that we cannot identify who you personally are from your
      visit data.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are still uncomfortable with us monitoring your visits to this
      site, you can turn on
      <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track">Do Not Track</a> in
      your browser. This will include a request not to include your visit in
      analytics, which we will strictly honour.

      Access to personal data and the right to be forgotten
    </h2>

    <p>
      As we do not store any personal data, there is nothing for you to
      request access to. Similarly, whilst we respect and support the right
      to be forgotten, there is no personal data we store that can be
      removed.
