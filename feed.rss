<p>This week I planned lots of user management work.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got to big bits of user management changes coming up: the ability to (properly) delete users and a redesign of all user management tools into one single application.</p>



<p>This is some solid foundational work, since we intend to make much wider changes to users and authentication in the next six months. By unifying and modernising the front-end, and filling functionality gaps, we&#8217;ll make those biggest changes much easier.</p>



<p>But we can&#8217;t just wade into such work! So I&#8217;ve spent a lot of the past two weeks writing proposals, prototypes and technical spikes that need to be reviewed/resolved before we can go ahead.</p>



<p>Whilst doing this, I&#8217;m starting to identify common steps to go through when speccing work. Hopefully we can extract the good bits to stay building a formal process whenever we are new milestones.</p>



<p>Next week we&#8217;ll answer the remaining few questions, both business and technical, and put ourselves in a position to actually start development.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Demoed user management prototype to business users</li><li>Ran technical kickoff for user management interface and created some related spikes</li><li>Wrote a proposal for deleting users and started chasing up remaining unanswered questions</li><li>Investigated a couple of spikes which didn&#8217;t go anywhere</li><li>Refactored some code I&#8217;d added to last week and spotted needed attention</li><li>Tidied up our Jira board, still trying to get the automation just right!</li></ul>

<p>This week I started making architecture plans.</p>



<p>This week we (team devs, tech arch, lead dev) had a couple of sessions to talk about how we want to rebuild the architecture of our application.</p>



<p>A brief summary of where we are: AngularJS frontend that hasn&#8217;t really been updated in five years pointing to a backend/API/database which is shared with another similarish service. We share some API requests (like <code>GET /me/tasks</code>) but not others (like <code>POST /lpa/create</code>), in a way that&#8217;s very hard to untangle.</p>



<p>We did a bit of a <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks Radar</a> exercise, identifying our current stack and what we want to keep, reduce or ditch, and then doing the same for technologies we&#8217;d used elsewhere or wanted to explore.</p>



<p>This gave us a fairly clear understanding of our direction of travel, some immediate spikes to dig deeper into some of our tech options, and a sense of unity in making these improvements.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Identifying plans for our new tech stack</li><li>Replacing old APIs with newer versions</li><li>Letting ESLint autofix everything it can so each diff is less cumbersome</li><li>Little fixes and tweaks to our new letters to make them more robust</li></ul>

<p>This week I started to take ownership of my code.</p>



<p>In last week&#8217;s weeknotes, I talked about the stress I felt under of being partially responsible fora lot of old, untouched code.</p>



<p>With reassurance that I can own that code, I&#8217;ve started to take control of things a bit more. I had a task to edit an aging and oddly-designed API, and took the opportunity to clean it up and plan for the future a little more.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot to untangle here and it&#8217;ll take time, but these baby steps will make a start and also help me feel more comfortable with the code base.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also started talking seriously about how to split up the code between the two entangled services, which is another huge task.</p>



<p>Some things can just be split apart, but for the rest we&#8217;re probably going to duplicate all of the code and let each service remove the parts they don&#8217;t need. This puts a bit more pressure on each service, but gives us autonomy and independence to make improvements aligned with our separate service goals.</p>

<p>This week I tried to handle my stress.</p>



<p>The last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been quite stressed. My new service involves working on a vast existing stack which is intimidating and recognised as being a bit janky.</p>



<p>A bit of background: a few years ago we thought it would be sensible to build two back-office systems into one stack. It would mean sharing common code and allow developers to work across both systems at once.</p>



<p>Years later we regret it. The two systems simply aren&#8217;t similar enough and we&#8217;re now inextricably tied together. Product decisions are hard to make because they typically affect both services.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s a nightmare as a developer. I&#8217;ve found myself trying to fix bugs only to cause them for a team working on something different. I&#8217;ve had to negotiate changes with other teams. Our release schedule is tied to other services (so e.g. there&#8217;s no hotfix process available).</p>



<p>Add to that the multiple technologies, libraries and patterns, and it feels like stumbling around in a dark room full of mousetraps.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;m surrounded by a great team who I trust. So I can deal with this stress rather than letting it hurt me.</p>



<p>Firstly, I told everyone about it. It&#8217;s easy to feel weak or vulnerable when stressed, but it&#8217;s an indication that something in the business is wrong. If you feel uneasy speaking up, then the stress will never dissipate, you&#8217;ll resent your job, and it&#8217;ll hurt you worse.</p>



<p>I talked to my team, close colleagues and our lead developer. They were all supportive and keen to understand the cause of the stress so that could help resolve it. Just feeling like people were on my side helped me personally, and I&#8217;m sure it will lead to other decisions to help move forward.</p>



<p>Secondly, I tried to identify the root causes of my stress. That&#8217;s hard, because the very nature of stress makes it difficult to focus and, frankly, everything feels awful. I made progress by writing notes of my concerns, then a few days later reviewing them and narrowing them down further. Ultimately it came down to:</p>



<ul><li>Feeling like I was doing bad quality work</li><li>Having too much responsibility</li><li>Not having enough ownership</li><li>Worrying about getting in others&#8217; way</li><li>Not having an opportunity to develop myself and my skills</li></ul>



<p>Lastly, I spoke to my line manager and principal developer. He encouraged me to go back to focusing on problems and solving them, because that&#8217;s what we do.</p>



<p>And, ultimately, my stress seems to come to a simple solution: we need to smash this codebase in half and separate the two systems. It won&#8217;t be easy, or fast, but it benefits the business and deals with my causes of stress:</p>



<ul><li>Building components from scratch, I can build them to my standards</li><li>I&#8217;ll be responsible only for our service, not the other one</li><li>I&#8217;ll (we&#8217;ll) have direct ownership, rather than awkwardly sharing it with others</li><li>There won&#8217;t be other teams/services to bump into</li><li>There&#8217;ll be lots of new work and I can identify opportunities to improve myself</li></ul>



<p>That conversation was yesterday, so I&#8217;m still digesting my new-found clarity. But it&#8217;s a good place to start.</p>



<p>Next week I&#8217;ll focus on a few things</p>



<ul><li>Getting buy-in from colleagues that we need to look at splitting</li><li>Documenting the problems splitting will solve</li><li>Identifying opportunities to easily split the codebase</li><li>Identifying dependencies and blockers that might inhibit splitting or the order in which we do it</li></ul>



<p>My worry now is that all of that might lead to <em>more</em> stress. But I&#8217;m starting to develop the tools to manage and handle that, and hope I can use them again to focus on what I can do right now and document the rest.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully update in a couple of weeks in how that&#8217;s going.</p>

<p>This week I wrote some letters.</p>



<p>But not any old letters! We&#8217;re putting some serious work into the letters sent to donors and attorneys when they register a new LPA.</p>



<p>The new letters will provide more detail on the rights and responsibilities of each actor and provide information on how to use their LPA online when contacting banks and similar.</p>



<p>This is quite a big deal, and a big change, which was unanticipated when we started this work (we thought we were just adding a paragraph).</p>



<p>Because of the large impact of the work (it&#8217;ll reach tens of thousands of people) and associated risks (I really don&#8217;t want to be part of a &#8220;government sends incorrect letter&#8221; news article) we&#8217;re doing a few things:</p>



<p>Firstly, we&#8217;ve split the work down into smaller chunks. Rather than a complete rewrite, we&#8217;re starting with just the &#8220;use it online&#8221; info. We&#8217;ll slowly add more content as we&#8217;re comfortable.</p>



<p>Secondly, we&#8217;re keeping the old letters in rotation. This will allow us to do a slower rollout with a small group of new registrants (an A/B test).</p>



<p>Thirdly, we&#8217;re adding tests on the letter content. This will ensure the logic still holds as the letters get more complex (e.g. if there are multiple attorneys, we include a paragraph noting how they should work together).</p>



<p>Lastly, we&#8217;re pushing back on the logic complexity. Complexity introduces risk—particularly how our code currently works—so we want to balance personalisation with caution. This means since content may not apply to a recipient, but we&#8217;d rather that than risk <em>not</em> telling them something important.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Bit if a weird week here: I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about team/squad comms and—though I hate to say the words—horizon scanning.</p>



<ul><li>Added new letters for donor/attorney registration</li><li>Hotfixed a bug caused by a dependency upgrade (eurgh)</li><li>Started discussing integrations, and particularly Pact, cross-teams</li><li>Discussed and started experimenting with how to communicate more effectively between squads</li><li>Added some detail to our micro-frontend plans</li><li>Got more familiar with Laminas, so I can more effectively use it when doing backend dev work</li></ul>

<p>And, honestly, that took up a lot of my time and most of my mental energy. I still got some work done, but it was a slow burn.</p>



<p>To highlight a good thing though: we had a team meeting on Thursday to realign our integration work. It was a really positive meeting where I felt we got complete control of the work ahead.</p>



<p>More importantly though, it was nice to have a meeting with everyone on the same page: we all know what&#8217;s happening, what decisions need to be made and what the impact of work is.</p>



<p>That could just be a bit of new-team positivity, but I think it&#8217;s also because of our focus work stream. We&#8217;re fixing a few bugs and preparing other work, but at least 75% of our effort is on one clear task.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Deprecated a fork of TinyMCE to just use the mainline version</li><li>Fixed a bug that&#8217;s been sitting around for a few years (a benefit of having a dedicated team on this service!)</li><li>Added error handling to our publishing process</li><li>A bunch of tidying up our AngularJS to match ESLint&#8217;s expectations</li></ul>

<p>We&#8217;ve been focussing on a singular integration the past few weeks. We&#8217;re not ready to tie things together yet but there&#8217;s been a lot of prep work to write things together, set up tests and understand what new code will be needed.</p>



<p>This week I took the opportunity to slow down, step back and write some damn documentation. We&#8217;ve effectively done a bunch of R&amp;D but are keeping the learnings in our head or on ephemeral Jira tickets.</p>



<p>As an old boss of mine used to say, we have to &#8220;share the knowledge&#8221;. Not just in our team, and for anyone new who comes along, but to rationalise what&#8217;s in our heads.</p>



<p>A major output has been two wiki pages which I think should help. The first is a description of how we&#8217;ve set up Pact to run effective unit tests, and how future integrations can reuse our code.</p>



<p>The second is a little grid of all of the tools/techniques we&#8217;re using and whether they&#8217;re reusable. As we adopt more micro-services I hope this will help build some standards rather than reinventing the wheel every time.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Lots of code investigation</li><li>Uploading our Pact output to the broker</li><li>Some slow but necessary steps forward on my JavaScript physics engine</li><li>I&#8217;m moving house this weekend which is understandably taking up lots of time and mental space!</li></ul>

<p>This week I learnt a lot.</p>



<p>I spent this week engrossed in new things, as my first week moving into my new team for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>It was overwhelming at times, and talked to loads of people, but I come out of it excited about the future and ready to sink my teeth in.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got a lot to overcome as a team before we can reach cadence. A big one amongst them is extricating our code from the existing monorepo so that we have more control over it. Then we have to rewrite it all. Plenty to keep busy!</p>



<p>In the meantime, we&#8217;ve picked up some smaller tickets and started tidying up the development environment to our needs. Good progress to have pull requests merged in in week one, I think.</p>



<p>This also meant saying goodbye to my friends and DigiDeps. It&#8217;s been a great year and we&#8217;ve made real improvements, and I&#8217;m excited to see what they do next. I hope I wasn&#8217;t holding anyone back but I think a leaver gives everyone a fresh look at the service and hopefully that&#8217;ll lead to some great ideas.</p>



<h2>Some of the things which are new this week</h2>



<ul><li>New team (Vega!)</li><li>New colleagues</li><li>New service (Sirius)</li><li>New business context (Lasting Power of Attorney)</li><li>New user base (Civil servants)</li><li>New technology (AngularJS)</li><li>New tooling</li><li>New tests</li><li>New CI (Jenkins)</li><li>New vision (micro frontends)</li></ul>

<p>This week I finished off my Complete the deputy report work.</p>



<p>It was a bit of a slow handover week this week, since from next Monday I&#8217;m moving to a new team. I finished off some final stories, updated some documentation and and slowly slinked into the shadows.</p>



<p>Having said that, I have two tickets to release still so will have to dip in next week.</p>



<p>Amongst that time though we&#8217;ve made some important progress. There was a full end-to-end test of our documents integration on Friday (successfully!) and we&#8217;re now recording much better reference data behind-the-scenes (it&#8217;ll start to be used in coming weeks).</p>



<p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be picking up new tools, datasets, colleagues and learning about a different development/CI process. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have a bug fix out by the end of the week, but the main goal is just to get on top of things.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m excited to pick up something new and be able to focus on since topics I really care about (usability, accessibility, performance) in the front end space.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Finished code to generate court order data at ingestion</li><li>Reviewed and updated pretty much all the DigiDeps documentation</li><li>Some extra tasks to prepare for Symfony upgrade</li><li>Reduced our upload limit from 15MB to 5MB (due to limitations in AWS Lambda)</li><li>Changed versioning to match Git rather than arbitrarily auto-incrementing</li><li>Started kick off for the new team (&#8220;Vega&#8221;?)</li><li>Started building a physics engine in JavaScript for a bit of fun (our definitions of &#8220;fun&#8221; may vary)</li></ul>

<p>Mostly I&#8217;ve been doing some kickoff work to make our database more reflective and effective. This has meant getting in deep with Symfony and Doctrine, which has been quite helpful.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Building new entities to handle court orders in Complete the deputy report</li><li>Debugging JMS Serialiser issues</li><li>Started looking at Storybook alongside React to build a UI library</li><li>Building my Node.js API (added better error handling, entity relationships, testing)</li></ul>

<p>This week I started shifting to a new team.</p>



<p>So the big news for me this week is that we&#8217;re making a new team at OPG which I&#8217;m going to be a developer on.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll be focusing on better supporting colleagues working from home, and modernising a central system (with exciting words like React and Micro frontend).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll write more about this as we get into it over the coming weeks but it&#8217;s following on well from research/planning work I&#8217;ve been doing with JN and I&#8217;m excited to go back to frontend development.</p>



<p>Whilst the team engine is still being built, I&#8217;m working on finishing up work on Complete the deputy report. We&#8217;ve been good at communicating and documenting, so this isn&#8217;t a big handover situation; I just want to see off what I&#8217;m working on.</p>



<p>A lot of that this week has been page headings. Bit of a snooze fest for most but our headings are rubbish and unclear, particularly for screen reader users. I&#8217;ve been simplifying them, aligned with GDS standards, and making sure they look the same visually and semantically.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not glamorous work, but it&#8217;s good work dammit. And it&#8217;s been bugging me since I started on this service a year ago, so nice to fix before I move on to new things.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Fixed as many headings as possible</li><li>A bunch of releases and code reviews</li><li>Ongoing work with integrations and simplifying our database</li><li>Started to think/talk about new team goals and delivery</li></ul>

<p>This is one of those weeks I forgot to write weeknotes, so I&#8217;m doing a quick summary.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve done a bunch of cleanup tasks this week: deleting old code, rewriting to modern standards, overcoming deprecations. It&#8217;s good work, though leads to so quite terrifying PRs (if you&#8217;re removed 1,000 lines of code, are you sure they&#8217;re the right ones?!)</p>



<p>I also wrote a whole load of tickets related to an accessibility audit we had. This picked up on some really good things: some major rewrites, some quick fixes. We&#8217;ll play them in the coming weeks as we get availability.</p>



<p>This week&#8217;s work wraps up the &#8220;move to GOV.UK Notify&#8221; epic, which is good to have out of the way. &#8220;Court orders&#8221;, &#8220;Upgrade Symfony&#8221;, &#8220;Audit logging&#8221; and &#8220;Accessibility audit&#8221; are just around the corner, but hopefully we won&#8217;t have too many in play at once.</p>



<p>And integrations work continues apace, with hopes that the majority of the hard work is now behind us.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Removed old email code: this was far reaching and caused a real mess in some places. Now we use a single HTTP-based API, a lot of our security configuration is simplified too.</li><li>Tidied up how we inject services in Symfony. This was a requirement for the v4 upgrade and a satisfying piece of work in general.</li><li>Integrations bug fixes and tweaks</li><li>Started building a Node/Express API for a extra curricular project to do with quizzes (which takes me back to my <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/introducing-quizzard">first blog post on this site</a>)</li></ul>

<p>This week I prepared the runway for Symfony 4.</p>



<p>Complete the deputy report currently runs on Symfony 3.4, which is falling out of support this November. Before then we&#8217;re planning to do a double upgrade to version 5. As well as giving us a supported version of the framework, we&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of the latest features and build a best-practice application.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">However, a lot has changed between versions 3 and 5. And it turns out we never fully upgraded from version 2, so we&#8217;re lagging way behind where we need to be. We still need to switch properly to dependency injection, update our folder structure and change lots of peer dependencies.</p>



<p>A few years ago I would&#8217;ve laughed in the face of this task and &#8220;just done it&#8221;. I&#8217;d upgrade to version 5, start fixing things which don&#8217;t work, and inevitably have a code freeze during this whole process.</p>



<p>For the ensuing months I&#8217;d find things which didn&#8217;t work and weren&#8217;t covered by tests, things I didn&#8217;t fix properly, and improvements that I missed.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;ve learnt from my experiences and am treating this now carefully. I&#8217;ve read through all the upgrade notes, identitied breaking changes that affect us and broken them down into manageable tasks.</p>



<p>Most importantly, I&#8217;ve identified which if these tasks can be done before actually performing the upgrade (as it turns out, most of them). So now we can slowly fix things in the background before taking the plunge. There&#8217;ll still be some issues I&#8217;m sure, but they&#8217;ll be easier to deal with because a lot of the noise is resolved.</p>



<p>After the version 4 upgrade is done, we&#8217;ll do the same for version 5: fix everything we can up-front then upgrade cleanly when ready.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s one big gap in my knowledge: Symfony Flex. I don&#8217;t yet understand what it&#8217;s for, how it works, or if we need it. I need to do more research to figure out what benefits it&#8217;ll give us and when is easiest to install (it&#8217;s new in version 4 but I suspect easiest to install <em>after</em> our version 5 upgrade is fully complete).</p>



<p>This task will be a marathon, not a sprint, and I&#8217;ll keep updated on how it progresses.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Planned our Symfony 4 upgrade and started the preparation work</li><li>Finished designing the documents admin panel, though this will need revisiting because AS has made massive strides with the integration work &#x1f389;</li><li>More admin panel design updates</li><li>Made user account emails and roles immutable: privilege escalation now requires removing and recreating the account</li><li>Productive session writing React Hooks for Sirius micro-frontends</li><li>We had an all-hands on Zoom, which was an interesting new experience</li><li>Used video calls on Zoom, Meet, Hangouts, Discord, Slack and WhatsApp to stay in touch with people. This is getting a bit out-of-hand, we need better cross-platform tools</li><li>Started playing with the be Phaser JS game development library. It&#8217;s got some great stuff, but isn&#8217;t well set up for ES6 class-based development so I&#8217;m writing some wrappers</li></ul>

<p>This week I swept up behind myself.</p>



<p><em>I&#8217;m going to reflect on the impact of COVID-19</em> <em>below because it feels important to do so. I&#8217;ll put it in a separate section so you can easily skip it.</em></p>



<p>We started a new sprint this week, and it came with a lot of carry-over (as is sometimes the case, nobody&#8217;s perfect). That&#8217;s led to picking our battles a bit more wisely, since we don&#8217;t want to increase the ticket queue. As such, I started the sprint with a bunch of technical upgrades and debt payoff.</p>



<p>A few more interesting tickets remain though. For one, we had a security incident over the weekend which I helped deal with on Monday. In the spirit of transparency you can <a href="https://opgtransform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DigiDeps/pages/1422098446/16+March+2020+Access+control+incident">read the details of our investigation online</a>. It turned out to be (some level of) user error, but we&#8217;re putting additional safeguards in place to protect against similar issues in the future.</p>



<p>I also spent more time on our ever encompassing integration. AE and AS have done some amazing work at writing isolated, loosely coupled code and I helped look at some of the contract testing which is going exactly where we want it to.</p>



<p>On my own end, I updated the admin UI to show information about how the integration is performing. It was one of those satisfying bits of work that touches every part of our service in one small way. Hopefully next week we&#8217;ll have the bulk of the integration done and can just do tweaks to finish it off.</p>



<h2>Isolation, quarantine and what that means for DigiDeps</h2>



<p>I work in a distributed team, based across sites in Birmingham and Nottingham. We often work from home, some of us moreso than in the office. As such, the switch to home working has been fairly straightforward so far.</p>



<p>Tuesday was our first all-remote retrospective/planning and I think it went great. We&#8217;re still figuring out how to transfer our in-person practices to digital (particularly voting and anonymish sticky notes), but I reckon we got a good 90% of value out of that session.</p>



<p>As of next week though, we&#8217;ll have to contend with children. Most of the team have kids in the house now and will be acting primarily as carers. There&#8217;s no doubt this will affect our output/velocity/other business-y words.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s fine, right? Most of the changes to our service aren&#8217;t more important than raising a child safely and securely. And any that are can easily get done by skeleton staff. The &#8220;nice to have&#8221;s can be pushed back without mercy, whilst we wait for this  situation to stabilise a bit.</p>



<p>So my view (as not a delivery manager, not a senior dev, not a line manager, just an observer) is that we intentionally ramp down a little bit and manage our prioritisation more closely. We should focus on the things that <em>need</em> to happen first, then work on the more important bits, but be happy to let things slip.</p>



<p>I reckon that looks something like:</p>



<ol><li>Keep the live service running</li><li>Be available to other teams who need support</li><li>Work on high priority tickets</li><li>Improve resilience/reduce cost</li><li>Work on low priority tickets</li></ol>



<p>That&#8217;s a start. We need to identify external expectations and how things should be prioritised, but I think we  need to be realistic, pragmatic and flexible in these challenging times.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Investigated the security incident</li><li>Updated admin UI to handle integration</li><li>Helped write contract tests for integration point</li><li>Upgraded GOV.UK Design System on all our products</li><li>Tweaked npm audit to be more useful<ul><li>We&#8217;ve had a spate of deep-chain vulnerabilities recently which just aren&#8217;t being fixed. We need to balance being aware of problems with being able to release.</li></ul></li><li>Various bits of pairing</li><li>Set up automated deployment with GitLab CI and openconnect into a corporate firewall<ul><li>I think I&#8217;ll have to write a blog post on this, it was really interesting and satisfying work</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>This week I built a daemon.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t like the term &#8220;daemon&#8221;. It feels like an unnecessarily arsey way of saying &#8220;background process&#8221;, particularly when talking to non-programmer-y colleagues. But I <em>do</em> like grand, concise ledes for my weeknotes.</p>



<p>This background process forms a key part of our infrastructure for the integration we&#8217;re building. In orchestration terms, I&#8217;ve built a conductor to decide what to play and why, and my colleagues are crafting a body of musicians who can do all the hard work of playing. Two halves of the same puzzle.</p>



<p>Part of the background process involved implementing a feature flag, so we can turn it on and off on-demand. I&#8217;ve hopefully done this in a reusable way, so we can quickly and confidently add more feature flags in the future.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve made a few more iterations with email this week too, which feels very agile and iterative. It&#8217;s nice that we&#8217;re now comfortable enough with the service to &#8220;just do&#8221; things rather than having to understand components first. And tests are continuing apace to make us feel more confident there too.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Built and deployed a background service to upload documents on report submission (eventually)</li><li>Created our first feature flag</li><li>Updated the design of the admin panel</li><li>Did a bit of gap analysis on out-of-date contact details we hold for deputies</li><li>Introduced better, formalised healthchecks to our services</li><li>Increased startup time by building the service caches on build rather than deploy</li><li>Started fixing a bunch of PHPStan errors in the API</li><li>Regained access to the UCL VPN and reoriented LSGNT status across environments</li></ul>

<p>This might not sound like much of an achievement, but it&#8217;s been a big gap in our testing coverage.</p>



<p>The limiting factor has been how to mock out services: we want to ensure the email sender is used, but not actually send it.</p>



<p>A few things have made this easier: enabling autowiring, a better understanding of Symfony and its configuration options, and a real need for these tests.</p>



<p>As far as I&#8217;m aware, there&#8217;s now <em>nothing</em> we can&#8217;t test. This is great news for our test confidence, but also our coverage measurement: if we can cover everything in unit tests, we can measure it easily. Up until now we&#8217;ve been limited to end-to-end testing, which is hard to measure.</p>

<p> (Last week I created a Pact file, but missed weeknotes). </p>



<p>This week I started moving some big changes forwad.</p>



<p>In Complete the deputy report, we have a few big changes in the pipeline. I&#8217;ve discussed before that having multiple significant strands at once isn&#8217;t my preferred approach, but here we are in the real world where things can&#8217;t move at the pace I&#8217;d like.</p>



<p>This week I&#8217;ve worked on a range of stories that set the groundwork for these big changes: moving more emails to GOV.UK Notify, creating a new permissions structure for administrators, rewriting tests in a standalone format, and making changes to database tables which will be necessary for our upcoming integrations.</p>



<p>That means the next few weeks will be chasing down the middle or tail ends of these projects: deprecating our old email service, redesigning the admin portal, rewriting more tests, and building an integration. Hopefully not too simultaneously.</p>



<h2>Making a Pact</h2>



<p><em>The update that I would have written last week.</em></p>



<p>I spent a lot of the week working with <a href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</a> and planning how we might integrate it into our projects and workflows. Pact is a kind of all-in-one contract testing tool, which provides mocking for contracted services and keeps track of tests to ensure their contract (or &#8220;pact&#8221;) is being met.</p>



<p>From a consumer (consumer = app using API) perspective you write out some expectations of how API requests should go (pseudocode follows):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pact
  .onRequest('GET', '/users')
  .willReturn(arrayOf(objectWith(
    id: /&#91;0-9]+/,
    username: /&#91;a-z0-9-_]{8,16}
  ))
  .suchAs(&#91;
    { id: 4, username: 'toddsmith' },
    { id: 353953, username: 'lithiumrogue' },
  ]);</code></pre>



<p>Pact then runs a mock server with these responses baked in, and you can run unit tests against code which calls it:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>const users = api.getUsers();

expect(users).toHaveLength(2);
expect(users&#91;0].id).toBe(4);

pact.verify();</code></pre>



<p>This way you ensure that you&#8217;re code is making API requests as anticipated, and handling the response correctly, alongside your existing unit tests.</p>



<p>At the end of the tests, Pact generates a JSON file containing all of your expectations (so a more formal and language-independent version of my pseudocode above) to provide a concrete document of how the consumer expects the API to behave.</p>



<p>Finally, there&#8217;s a tool call <a href="https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker">Pact Broker</a> which collates these JSON files and tests them against the API (in a test environment). This completes the validation of the end-to-end service, with each end being tested independently and without developers needing to both services.</p>



<p>This may seem like a lot of effort for minimal gain (I suggest, as someone who&#8217;s spent a week grappling with this), but it should shine when we have multiple APIs, consumers and endpoints. We could have a large number of consumer apps, all using different parts of the API and producing Pact JSON files for the bits they need. Then the Broker checks <em>all</em> of these automatically and provides realtime feedback about the overall health of our (and our associates&#8217;) services.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure this is just the start of our Pact journey, particularly because our scale is currently miniscule (one API, one consumer, two endpoints). Hopefully I&#8217;ll post an update in a few months to see how it&#8217;s going.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Created a new &#8220;Super admin&#8221; role group, to reduce the amount of permissions/responsibilities we give to admins</li><li>Finished adding suitable retention periods to all our log groups</li><li>Converted some emails to use GOV.UK Notify</li><li>Added new database fields in preparation of integrating our document submission process</li><li>Deleted or clarified a bunch of old tickets that were no longer relevant</li><li>Fixed some realtime service availability issues </li><li>Started using Terraform to manage more of my personal infrastructure (including parts of this site)</li><li>Started building a <a href="https://metunnel.glitch.me/">custom YouTube interface</a> as a side project (partly to exfiltrate some taste data from YouTube, partly to explore some APIs)</li></ul>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/26u4exk4zsAqPcq08/giphy.webp" alt="Awkwafina celebrating an award"/></figure>



<p>Very exciting stuff! This wasn&#8217;t strictly necessary, and doesn&#8217;t give me any permission to do anything special, but it&#8217;s nice to recognise personal development.</p>



<p>I celebrated this success by spending a day and a half messing with databases and planning ways to improve resilience and save money.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m really happy with how much I&#8217;ve learnt over the past year with AWS, and it&#8217;s quite empowering to know the possibilities of what I can build now. But I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve dived deep into one cloud provider of many, so I&#8217;m interested in looking at direct competetitors (Azure, Google Cloud Platform) and other technologies in the space (e.g. Kubernetes).</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Passed my AWS Cloud Practitioner exam</li><li>Built a proof-of-concept for our documents integration, which is a big step forward alongside other work in the department</li><li>Investigated moving to Amazon Aurora to make our databases scalable</li><li>Moved our email sender to a dedicated IP address since our shared IP has been blocked by some spam lists (nature of cloud infrastructure)</li><li>Investigated a memory leak on our PDF generator, though I ultimately had to give up because there was no clear solution and the leak itself isn&#8217;t causing any problems for end users</li></ul>

<p>This week I made our project open source.</p>



<p>Point 12 in the GOV.UK Service Standard is to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open">make new source code open</a>. Our source code <em>used</em> to be open (<a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digi-deps-api">API</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digi-deps-client">Client</a>), but got locked up after moving to a new monorepo alongside some sweeping infrastructure changes.</p>



<p>Yesterday, we finally got to the point of being happy to make it open again:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digideps">https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digideps</a></p>



<p>This is whole full service source code: PHP applications, design, infrastructure, end-to-end testing. All our <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digideps/pulls">pull requests</a> are out in the open too. The only things that remain behind closed doors are Slack and JIRA, which often contain sensitive data (in all forms).</p>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to peruse more GOV.UK Service source code, many of our MOJ and OPG repositories are open source: <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice">https://github.com/ministryofjustice</a></p>



<h2>Why is being open source important?</h2>



<p>Some of the reasons I&#8217;m really happy to open source our work:</p>



<ul><li>Citizens can see what we&#8217;re building</li><li>Citizens can contribute to what we&#8217;re building</li><li>Anyone can reuse bits of our work</li><li>It puts us in a public-serving mentality</li><li>It encourages good coding practices (by increasing the impact of bad practices)</li><li>It&#8217;s an opportunity to celebrate and show off our work</li><li>It gives us access to free tooling available to open source projects</li></ul>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Moved all of our alarms from email to Slack: we now have a workflow for assigning, resolving and communicating issues</li><li>Open sourced our repository</li><li>Tidied up a bunch of unused resources in AWS</li><li>Finished the rollout of our database certificate updates</li><li>A bunch more integration prepping, and discussing integration prepping</li><li>Did some practical work around React Hooks and Context with JN; it&#8217;s come a long way since I used it last</li></ul>

<p>This week I started integrating.</p>



<p>Not on a personal level: it&#8217;s almost been a year and I think we&#8217;ve comfortably crossed that line. I&#8217;m talking about integrating services </p>



<p>At the start of the year, we set up an &#8220;Integrations Team&#8221; who are responsible for designing and building APIs between our services. The (/an) intended benefit is that they don&#8217;t really worry about what happens in each service, but just define the contract and shared data. This should unblock individual service teams developing dependent features.</p>



<p>The integrations team is still in early days (it&#8217;s only been a few weeks), but things are clipping along at a fair pace. They&#8217;ve published a bunch of standards (in the form of ADRs), built infrastructure, and provided early drafts of contracts.</p>



<p>As a result, we&#8217;re having to get our skates on in the service teams. So I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time this week communicating with and through Integrations colleagues, designing new features, and worrying about handling edge cases and downtime.</p>



<p>The plan is that next week we&#8217;ll agree how we&#8217;ll design and build <em>our</em> end of the integration, and start building it for real next sprint. We&#8217;ll also hook up our healthcheck page to the API&#8217;s to ensure the piping works.</p>



<p>As I say, things are still nascent for this new way of working, but I&#8217;m optimistic about having a centralised team. It should unlock us having a common language across services, and moving forward together rather than at a product level.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Started designing our document API integration</li><li>Reinstated some API security that had been found lacking</li><li>Built a scheduled cleanup task to tidy up inside users</li><li>Tidied up a bunch of dodgy data in production</li><li>Supported developing multi-organisation and GOV.UK Notify support</li><li>Continued to think about our major Symfony upgrade later this year</li></ul>

<p>This week I spent more time than I&#8217;d like fixing the basics.</p>



<p>Over the past week or two I&#8217;ve been working on Serve OPG, an internal service of ours. It&#8217;s a simple little service which required some important but fairly small changes. Unfortunately, we came across a bunch of issues when trying to release the work that we&#8217;ve had to spend time fixing: pipelines not working, flaky tests, misconfigured environments.</p>



<p>Obviously these are good things to fix, but I hate doing this work unanticipated. It&#8217;s a big time sink, and a massive distraction. It affects morale and gets in the way of other sprint work, knocking back estimates and deadlines.</p>



<p>The important thing is that it&#8217;s done, but this has been a harsh reminder of what happens when you let things fall into disrepair. If we&#8217;d taken the time to look at and fix this earlier, it wouldn&#8217;t have been as arresting, we would&#8217;ve appreciated the value, and I think we would have spent less time on it.</p>



<p>So what am I doing to improve it? Firstly, I&#8217;m trying to be more aware of my surroundings when planning work. Implementing changes may be easy, but tests, side effects and CI/CD have to be considered too. We run a fully integrated DevOps cycle, so I can&#8217;t just estimate the dev time and throw the rest over the fence.</p>



<p>Second, I&#8217;m going to endeavour to appreciate and communicate the value of fixing the basics. Spending two days &#8220;tidying our pipeline&#8221; may seem like lost time, but if it speeds up all future builds then we&#8217;ll quickly make the time back. And if I describe it as &#8220;decrease our build time&#8221; instead, everyone can understand the value.</p>



<p>Lasly, I want to slow down our ticket lifecycle a bit. That&#8217;s not to say that I want to do less work, I just want to increase value and collaboration of our work. Rather than trying to &#8220;quickly&#8221; put in a new feature, I want to ensure it&#8217;s properly planned, designed and understood. We should know how we&#8217;ll test it, understand the value and the risks. That means more time thinking up-front, and more pushing back in refinement/planning sessions.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Finally released Serve OPG work and cleared up the pipeline for future releases</li><li>Spent a lot of time discussing testing best practices with AE and AS</li><li>Started building some React components with JN using TDD and ping-pong collaboration (which was quite fun)</li><li>Continued to discuss and plan a few upcoming epics and integrations</li><li>Started to update certificates on all our databases</li><li>Finally found the (a?) cause of a data-duplication bug</li></ul>

<p>This week I made a lot more work for myself (but in a good way!)</p>



<p>Two important things are happening in OPG Digital at the moment: various new staff are joining us, and it&#8217;s the start of the calendar year. So naturally, we&#8217;re having a lot of good conversations about what 2020 has in store for our services, platform, way of working etc.</p>



<p>The upshot of this for me personally has been a selection of planning meetings, writing and refining tickets. We&#8217;re planning major new features, important rewrites and integrations across OPG services.</p>



<p>All of this leads to fairly mixed emotions: I&#8217;m excited to look ahead at the work we&#8217;ll do, some of which is going to open so many great opportunities, but nervous about the amount of effort and risk we&#8217;ll be taking on. I think pacing will be important: we need to get better at finishing epics before we move onto the next ones.</p>



<p>The other nice side of this is working across different products and service teams to plan and communicate our plans. This week I&#8217;ve been actively developing two products and planning across two more. It&#8217;s meant working with new colleagues and picking up new skills, which is always awesome.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Writing and refining tickets galore</li><li>Finalising and releasing my virus scanner work</li><li>Adding a full user management suite to Serve OPG (using pairing and TDD with AS)</li><li>Talking to JN about React and microfrontends</li><li>Discussing our team testing strategy going forward</li></ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week I wrote my first <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always thought of Lambda&#8217;s as one of <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS&#8217;s</abbr> signature features. It&#8217;s one of the first I heard about and it really exemplifies what makes AWS differ from a traditional virtual hosting provider. Admittedly it&#8217;s not really a unique feature any more (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/">GCP</a> have their own alternatives), but it was an eye-opener to me when I first heard about the modern public cloud.</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, Lambdas/Functions are simple scripts which are run on-demand and you&#8217;re only charged for the execution time. They&#8217;re perfect for uncommon, intensive tasks so you can effectively pop open a server for 30 seconds every few hours as needed.</p>



<p><em>Anyway</em>, I&#8217;ve never written one and we haven&#8217;t used them in any products I&#8217;ve worked on. That is, until this week, when I&#8217;ve written a very simple Lambda to restart one of our services on a semi-regular basis (which sounds as iffy as it is, but is due to reliance on a third-party image).</p>



<p>This has slightly been a rite of passage, and a good thing to cross off my personal development list, but it also indicates a growing confidence with cloud hosting and ability to just muck in with such things. Very exciting indeed.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>We&#8217;re in the post-winter-break period now, in which everyone can freely shrug off responsibility for two weeks by saying they&#8217;re still getting into the swing of it. That might sound critical, but I genuinely like that we can all pick our own pace right now. It&#8217;s famously a bad time of the year for mental and physical health, and being able to pair that with a little self-care in your workload is really powerful.</p>



<p>My team has taken what I think is a very reasonable approach to our first sprint of the year: we&#8217;re fixing a bunch of bugs and &#8220;the basics&#8221; to make sure we&#8217;re in a good place to support our service and introduce bigger features. We&#8217;re also having a session next week to redefine what the service does, so we can better prioritise and align our work. Hopefully by the end of the month we&#8217;ll be designing and building high-quality unblocked work that&#8217;s really helpful to our users.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Unblocked the pipeline: some of our automated tests relied on referring to the current calendar year, which has recently changed. I made them more flexible rather than just updating the year.</li><li>Upgraded our PDF generator: we had a minor failure over the winter break, so I brought the generator back under our control and upgraded all the dependencies/OS.</li><li>Fixed the stability of our virus scanner: this was having trouble restarting smoothly, so I used a Lambda and some improved ECS configuration to make it more stable.</li><li>Started adding user management to Serve OPG</li><li>Planned some goals and personal development opportunities for 2020</li><li>Fought off a cold (though it&#8217;s having a late resurgence &#x1f641;)</li></ul>

<p>This week I took a look at what we achieved this year.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had a busy week. On Monday evening we took the plunge and switched a huge swathe of our users across to the new permissions model we&#8217;ve been working on. Wednesday was marked by an outage, Thursday was our Christmas celebration, on Friday we finally traced some issues we&#8217;ve known about for months (years?).</p>



<p>It all felt like <em>a lot</em> was going on, particularly given the time of year. It was a scary, tense, stressful week. But I&#8217;ve been keen to look at the bright side: how far we&#8217;ve come.</p>



<p>In the last few weeks, Complete the deputy report has felt particularly unstable. We&#8217;ve had a couple of minor outages, and we&#8217;ve come across boat loads of errors. However, I argue that this is good news because earlier in the year those errors were already around and we just weren&#8217;t aware of them.</p>



<p>My overriding theme for the last quarter of the year has been improving our monitoring and dealing with the problems that come out of it. These are issues our users have seen every day, but we weren&#8217;t aware of. We now get errors when they happen, letting us be proactive rather than waiting for a bug report.</p>



<p>Similarly, our outage on Wednesday. Without wanting to go into much detail, it was one of those &#8220;these things happen&#8221; issues that can&#8217;t really be predicted. The good news though is that we resolved everything within 15 minutes, and were already fixing it before users noticed.</p>



<p>This is all a bit of a Catch 22 though (or something similar): if we hadn&#8217;t made the improvements and weren&#8217;t aware of these problems, then we wouldn&#8217;t be as concerned with them. Instead, we know about everything that&#8217;s wrong and collectively have an uncomfortable view that things have gotten worse.</p>



<p>So, as we approach the end of the year, it&#8217;s good to look at what we&#8217;ve achieved. Monitoring is better; infrastructure is more reliable; we understand our system better; testing has better coverage; we&#8217;ve fixed tonnes of bugs, many are 4+ years old; CI is effective.</p>



<p>Next week I&#8217;ll take a early shot at some 2020 goals, but I truly wouldn&#8217;t be able to without the great work of 2019. We&#8217;re beyond &#8220;fixing the basics&#8221; here and into the serious territory of building a great system. I think our main problem now is having too many ideas.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Switched almost all non-lay deputies to the new permissions model<ul><li>A few &#8220;unusual&#8221; organisations remain on the old system for now, whilst we ensure we understand their needs</li><li>This crosses off a ticket that&#8217;s been in development for months, and sprint goal from the past 4 sprints.</li></ul></li><li>Reviewed the cases we can&#8217;t parse and set out plans to resolve them<ul><li>We&#8217;ve been aware of these for at least a year, but unable to do something about it. Recent code changes mean we&#8217;re now close to 100% coverage. The last remaining big goal is supporting lay and non-lay deputies on the same case.</li></ul></li><li>Restructured our preproduction environment for more logical separation of concerns</li><li>Resolved a migration issue which was causing unsuccessful deployments</li><li>Resolved a migration issue which was causing tests to be unreliable</li><li>Celebrated the festive season as a department with a treasure hunt and curling.</li></ul>

This week I handled handover.




One of our five developers left this week, and another is going in a couple of weeks. Nothing nefarious, just the end of their contracts.




Whilst we&#8217;re in the midst of recruitment to fill their boots, we&#8217;re also ensuring everything is handed over: not just work and knowledge but also permissions and responsibilities.




Losing staff is always sad, and always a risk. These two have been excellent colleagues and in part that&#8217;s been clear by how easy handover had been. Rather than everything being left to the last minute, we&#8217;ve spent months planning and preparing for this.




It reminds me of an axiom that I believe is credited to Netflix: that every developer is responsible for making themselves redundant. That plan a bit singularity-enticing, but I&#8217;ve always found it&#8217;s good to work as if you&#8217;re leaving next week. It leads to good practice in general and makes you much easier to work with.




<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Fully implemented autowiring. We&#8217;re seeing some of the benefits of how this works already.</li><li>Ensured succession of our departing WebOps colleague by engaging with the WebOps Community of Practice</li><li>More bug fixes based on alarms</li><li>Prepared for automation of switching organisations&#8217; ACLs: we&#8217;ve been doing this manually so far, but hope to big bang all the easy ones next week</li><li>A bunch of risk analysis, ticket planning etc. in preparation for being a smaller team.</li><li>Read Richard Pope&#8217;s fantastic playbook for <a href="https://t.co/hJulEzhMcT?amp=1">Government as a Platform</a> (YMMV, but this is exactly my jam right now)</li></ul>

<p>This week I fixed a lot of PHP errors.</p>



<p><a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/weeknotes-18th-november-2019">Last week</a> I talked about how I was reviewing logs and errors. We wanted to increase our error logging strictness so that we get properly notified when things go wrong.</p>



<p>After implementing the stricter rules though, we found lots of <em>existing</em> errors. We obviously don&#8217;t want to be unduly notified, so I spent a large chunk of week fixing a lot of them.</p>



<p>For the most part, this was simply a case of downgrading errors from <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.runtimeexception.php">RuntimeExceptions</a> to <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Exception/HttpException.php">HttpExceptions</a>, which Symfony gracefully turns into 403 and 404 errors.</p>



<p>The other major piece of work was deciding where errors should be thrown. For example, a report not being found is not really an error state, but a user who has <em>no</em> reports indicates that something has done wrong in our data process.</p>

<p>This week I started to review our service configuration. I&#8217;ve had a few tasks to do with how the services are put together: how errors are handled, what we send to logs, how we set memory limits.</p>



<p>This is really important work, mostly because of the risk of doing it wrong. Without correct logging, we won&#8217;t know when something goes wrong. Without suitable service configuration, we could be at risk of security breaches.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a good chance to fully understand how the different components of the application fit together and simplify wherever possible, but also a good opportunity to refactor code. Alongside our ongoing work to use <a href="https://phpstan.org/">PHPStan</a> to improve code quality, this means we&#8217;re taking some serious strides to bring things up to scratch.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Started adding additional useful information to our full review checklists</li><li>Finished implementation of my new CSV upload process from last week</li><li>Mobbed on some work to enforce user permission rules</li><li>Debugged some memory issues with document management</li><li>Began to overhaul our application logging and error handling</li><li>Planned some document management integration work with development colleagues</li><li>Attended a profession catchup in Nottingham with other devs, webops engineers and technical architects</li></ul>

I&#8217;m really interested in online privacy. I imagine friends would describe me from &#8220;helpful&#8221; to &#8220;privacy nut&#8221;, but it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s important to me.




I&#8217;m often just caught moaning about privacy though, not doing anything about it. I do my best when it comes to system design, sure, but I think I can fail a bit on the education side of things.




To that end, I want to talk more about the tools and techniques I use to help keep private online. It&#8217;s not foolproof, and there&#8217;s no one easy solution, but if it&#8217;s something you care about I can suggest practical steps that help maintain privacy without sacrificing comfort.




<h2>Firefox Focus</h2>



So I want to call out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/">Firefox Focus</a>, a mobile web browser made by Mozilla with privacy in mind.




Firefox Focus has a whole bunch of privacy-focused features, but I want to pull out the two which I think are key to what it does for me.




Firstly, it blocks third party trackers. These are the tools used to track you across different websites, so when you visit Company A and Company B, the third party tracker can tie those visits together and learn something about you.




When third party trackers watch you over many months, the data they build up can get really personal. Whilst not everyone&#8217;s using this for nefarious purposes, there are some well established weaponised trackers out there and blocking them is just good hygiene.




The second major feature is that Firefox Focus erases <em>all</em> your history at the end of a session. All the cache, all pageview history, all cookies. This is also designed to make you harder to track: when you close a session and come back to the same site, you look like a completely new visitor.




Erasing history has its annoyances: you have to re-login to websites in each session, and reselect your cookie preferences (which really makes you notice how crap they are) but that is where the question of how much comfort you&#8217;re willing to sacrifice comes in.




Because of that, I recommend having two browsers: one you use for accessing trusted sites that you want to stay logged in to, and Firefox Focus for your everyday browsing. That way you can get on with your regular life, but be a little more protected when you do regular browsing and visit sites you don&#8217;t trust.




One other thing to note about Firefox Focus is that <strong>not all sites work</strong> with it. Normally this is because they require third party cookies to function. Generally, that&#8217;s a <em>wild</em> expectation and you probably shouldn&#8217;t use the site for fears over how it handled your data, but if you must then that&#8217;s where your second browser comes in.




<h2>My setup</h2>



To quickly summarise, my mobile browser set up is this: Firefox Focus as my day-to-day and default browser. I use it for things like accessing news sites, looking up recipes and searching for info. It&#8217;s the most used so on my phone and probably accounts for &gt;95% of my mobile web browsing.




Then I&#8217;ve got (regular) Firefox for when I need it: accessing GitHub and Google Suite for work, and websites which Firefox Focus can&#8217;t support.




I&#8217;ve been using this setup for a couple of years and I find it great. The only annoyance is constantly dealing with cookie popups, but I often just accept them because Firefox Focus (and other tools) are protecting me from the harmful cookies anyway.

<p>This week I went to Ireland.</p>



<p>Not on a work trip, so it&#8217;s admittedly not that relevant, but it took two days out of my week so was a pretty key to me.</p>



<p>I came back having missed retro and planning on Tuesday, which is a bit of a weird position to be in: I&#8217;m doing all 13 days if the sprint but had no input into what went in.</p>



<p>I was broken back in quickly on Wednesday when we had a production-level outage at 10am. Investigation since has revealed that our Redis node fell offline because of a hardware failure. We were back up within ten seconds, but users were still impacted and that sucks.</p>



<p>A lot of the rest of the week was taken up with improving our error handling so we&#8217;re not at as much risk in the future. We&#8217;ll also be building in redundancy for Redis so we don&#8217;t have a single point of failure.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Deployed the full review checklist (see last week&#8217;s weeknotes) for all report types</li><li>Re-established role hierarchy in organisations</li><li>Provided better error pages during critical failures</li><li>Installed <a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan">PHPStan</a> to highlight coding errors</li><li>Investigated our vulnerability to some recent Nginx/PHP CVEs (we&#8217;re fine!)</li></ul>

<p>This week has been split into two major tasks: implementing the full review checklist and dealing with some upload/data errors.</p>



<p>The upload/data errors were discovered as part of our attempts to enable organisation-level access. Out of an abundance of caution we were watching the application in more detail and became aware of some issues.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a shake when these things pop up because they distract your focus even when unrelated to the task at hand. On the plus side, these are actual problems with a line system that we&#8217;re going to fix properly. It&#8217;s just a challenge to bake that work with cadence.</p>



<h2>Checklist data models</h2>



<p>I wanted to talk a bit about the data model for review checklists, since it&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time this week.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve long had a &#8220;lodging checklist&#8221; in Complete the deputy report, which is the first stage of reviewing whether a report is appropriate. The new &#8220;full review checklist&#8221; is checked against a subset of reports, either where escalation has been advised or when chosen at random.</p>



<p>The lodging checklist is backed up by a database table with a column for every question (e.g. has_deputy_documented_spending), which makes it quite unwieldy. It&#8217;s also hard to add new questions, as the database, entity model, API etc. all need to be updated.</p>



<p>With the full review checklist I&#8217;ve taken a different approach: there&#8217;s a &#8220;decision&#8221; field, and some metadata (reviewer, submission date) and a &#8220;answers&#8221; field. The &#8220;answers&#8221; contain a JSON blob with all of the specific questions asked and what the response was.</p>



<p>The benefit of this is that all validation and data management happen on the client side; the API just checks the JSON is valid. Changes to questions will be much easier, and we could expand this out to other checklists in the future (I&#8217;d like to retcon the lodging checklist into this structure also).</p>



<p>Part of the reason this would is that the questions in the checklist and fairly ephemeral: other parts of the application and reporting care about the final decision, but they don&#8217;t care about answers to individual questions. That level of detail is only needed on the checklist itself.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s great to get a chance to re-review checklists in this way. If we can update the lodging checklist too, I think we&#8217;ll be in a great position to sensibly and dynamically manage this data. It would also be one less bit of business data which we&#8217;re having to define.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Investigated and identified some CSV upload issues in our service</li><li>Reviewed how all 12,000+ clients will be handled by organisations</li><li>Implemented the new full review checklist</li><li>Moved our integration tests into a separate container</li><li>Removed a weird backdoor-y thing we set up for tests which isn&#8217;t used any more</li><li>Sat on a couple of interview panels for developers</li></ul>

<p>This week I sorted out our environment variables.</p>



<p>Just a short one this week, since I&#8217;m again doing it late. My notable piece of work was completely rewriting how we handled environment variables. We now use far less variables, they&#8217;re clearer and they&#8217;re only set where they&#8217;re needed.</p>



<p>This started off as a small task, where I just wanted to remove a few variables I knew we weren&#8217;t using. But with a little pushing it turned into a pretty major rewrite, addressing several of the issues we&#8217;ve identified over the past few months.</p>



<p>Amongst the changes are:</p>



<ul><li>removing several variables which simply aren&#8217;t being used</li><li>collapsing some variables together. For example, rather than having an individual variable for each internal email address, we just have one which is a flag of whether to send internal emails or not.</li><li>implementing sensible defaults. For example, Xdebug only needs to be enabled locally so it defaults to off. This means our servers don&#8217;t need to explicit confirm they don&#8217;t want it enabled.</li><li>removing unnecessary prefixes. Lots of our variables were prefixed &#8220;API_&#8221; of &#8220;FRONT_&#8221; to indicate which container they apply to, but this is obvious from context, particularly now that we use Terraform.</li></ul>



<p>This effective restart on environment variables will make our configuration and our debugging much clearer.</p>



<p>I hope it will also allow developers to be bolder when making future changes, because we won&#8217;t be prompted to worry about services that aren&#8217;t being used. For example, we were previously setting &#8220;OAUTH&#8221; environment variables which could make developers incorrectly assume the service used OAuth (perhaps sadly, it does not).</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Released the organisations code to production (this ticket has taken about six weeks to get released, so this is a big milestone!)</li><li>Tidied up the remaining organisations tickets</li><li>Rewrote our environment variables, removing about a dozen of them in the process</li><li>Redesigned the lodging checklist</li><li>Started implementing the new full-review checklist</li></ul>

<p>This week I unblocked our deployment pipeline.</p>



<p>Unblocking the pipeline wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily be a big highlight of my week, but this week we <em>really </em>blocked it and getting out of that was a big deal. I&#8217;ll talk about that more below.</p>



<p>We also ended up with a queue of changes stuck in the pipeline, including bug fixes, so Friday wound up being a ceremonious day of finally shipping a boat load of fixes to production that we&#8217;d fixed during the week.</p>



<p>Ultimately, blocking our releases for four days wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> big a deal: six months ago we would only release once or twice a week, so it shows how far we&#8217;ve come that this was even an issue. But I&#8217;m glad to be in a team where we&#8217;re striving to get better every day and not falling back on excuses like that.</p>



<h2>Pipeline blockage post-mortem</h2>



<p><em>With apologies to readers who don&#8217;t use web development lingo for an otherwise horrible subtitle.</em></p>



<p>I wanted to go through what caused our blockage this week, why it was particularly bad, how we solved it, and what I&#8217;ve learnt.</p>



<p>We have a &#8220;preproduction&#8221; environment that all code is deployed to before release. Sometimes we pause a release at this point to test something with realistic data (our test environments just have a bunch of fake, sanitised data). But because everything has to go through preproduction before release, this means all subsequent changes get blocked too: until the change we&#8217;re testing is approved, nothing can be released.</p>



<p>On Monday we made such a call, pausing releases and queuing up a few changes until testing was complete. But testing identified serious issues and we couldn&#8217;t release with them in place. Initially we tried to create a fix and send that into preproduction too, but it was more complex than expected and taking too long. Meanwhile, critical bugs were stacking up.</p>



<p>On Thursday we made the decision to pull the initial change out, freeing the pipeline and allowing us to release everything. However, this couldn&#8217;t be done automatically because the queue of other changes had confused matters.</p>



<p>Instead, we manually disabled the functionality (by commenting out some key lines), but left everything else in place. This meant that our final release ultimately looked like a behind-the-scenes refactor, and when we reintroduce the change next week (with the bug fixed), we&#8217;ll have a really small changeset that&#8217;s easier to manage.</p>



<p>I came up with a couple of new rules I suggest implementing when blocking a deployment pipeline:</p>



<ul><li>Try to make the blocker as small as possible: release behind-the-scenes code first and add nice-to-have improvements in a subsequent change later.</li><li>Schedule testing: agree to, for example, block on Monday at 9AM, test until midday, and either release or pull out at midday. Make sure everyone who&#8217;s needed to contribute to that can subscibe to those time scales.</li></ul>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Wrote various bug fixes for issues with Complete the deputy report</li><li>Identified a new way to handle &#8220;competing deputies&#8221; issues</li><li>Moved our automated test scripts into a separate container</li><li>Submitted <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/pull/85">my first PR</a> to the MoJ Design System</li><li>Started talking across OPG product teams about how we&#8217;ll use the MoJ Design System</li></ul>

<p>The OPG Digital team in Birmingham had a slight office move this week, descending from the 8th floor of our building to the 2nd. The new space gives us more space and, importantly, more control. We&#8217;ve been excited about this move for a while, and it&#8217;s exciting to see it finally come to fruition.</p>



<h2>Metrics</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of the last couple of weeks setting up a new platform for reporting important metrics to do with the Complete the deputy report service. This will allow us to measure satisfaction, user registrations and report submissions, and interrogate that data ad hoc.</p>



<p>In the past we&#8217;ve surveyed this information by running queries on the database when asked. As well as being an annoyingly manual process, we&#8217;ve also variously lost track of the queries used, meaning the month-by-month numbers could be inconsistent.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re currently recording quite basic information but we know we&#8217;ll want to expand this in the future, so we&#8217;ve designed the whole system to be easily extendable and expandable.</p>



<p>To achieve this, we&#8217;ve adopted a system we copied from Google Analytics, but which I&#8217;m sure is more widely used, which consists of metrics and dimensions. Each <strong>metric</strong> is a measurement we make in the application (e.g. satisfaction, report submissions, errors, completion times). Each <strong>dimension</strong> is a way of slicing those metrics up (e.g. report type, browser, day of week).</p>



<p>Each metric only supports <em>some</em> dimensions, either because they don&#8217;t make sense or because the way the data is stored couldn&#8217;t support it.</p>



<p>Behind-the-scenes, we&#8217;re storing each metric in its own file which contains the SQL used to query the data and the dimensions which are supported. New metrics simply sit in their own file, and new dimensions can be added as-and-when we need them.</p>



<p>As well as expanding our custom analytics to cover more metrics, I want to eventually cross-integrate with Google Analytics. This should not only let us see all our analytics in one place but also use dimensions across both, so we can for example identify the hits on our most popular pages split by user type.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Moved to our new OPG Digital office</li><li>Helped add new alarms to AWS to identify application errors</li><li>Ensured all alarms and Trusted Advisor notifications are sent to the development team</li><li>Fixed a bug with our API unit tests which was causing them to not invalidate builds</li><li>Researched and resolved some problems with downloading large numbers of documents at once</li><li>Discussed API integration between Complete the deputy report and Sirius</li></ul>

<p>This week I learnt how to pair.</p>



<p>At ceremonies on Tuesday we agreed as a team to do more pairing. Some of the team (and department) are really passionate about pairing, some (like me) have never really done it before. But certainly no-one was against the idea, so we decided to give it a go.</p>



<p>I think we dived into this experiment more than anticipated, with most of us spending the majority of the rest of the week closely (and remotely) pairing. It could be seen as a trial by fire, but I think we were all experienced and mature enough to just give it a fair short.</p>



<p>This only marks the beginning of our pairing journey, but we&#8217;ve learnt a few lessons already. Firstly, dodgy internet connections are really problematic when pairing remotely (sorry colleagues!). Secondly, choose your battles: we identified the core, complex work and paired on that, then separated to do the more mundane or tedious bits: filling our further tests, fiddling with HTML.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been lucky to have work that accommodates pairing excellently (it&#8217;s been quite complex and involved, and is also very important to the product), so it will be interesting to see how this momentum keeps up.</p>



<h2>Infrastructure as code</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve spent a fair amount of time with our infrastructure recently, and realised that I&#8217;ve grown in confidence with managing it. I thought this marked a good opportunity to give a brief intro to Infrastructure as code, and how we&#8217;re using Terraform.</p>



<p>The idea of the &#8220;Infrastructure as code&#8221; &#8220;movement&#8221; is that you can explain your infrastructure (servers, databases, DNS records, passwords etc. etc.) in a standardised format so that it can be applied automatically by tooling.</p>



<p>For example, you might have a file with a description of your database, including what the root password is and what other users/permissions should be granted. When run, your tool can then set up the database in your service provider of choice. If you need to change permissions, you re-run the tool and it will cleanly apply the updates (without destroying and recreating everything, wherever possibe).</p>



<p>There are various benefits of this, but among them:</p>



<ul><li>Your infrastructure is human-readable and in one place</li><li>If you put your infrastructure code into version control, you have a full audit history of changes made</li><li>There are no surprising changes squirreled away in admin consoles</li><li>You don&#8217;t have to deal with confusing (and sometimes misleading) provider UIs.</li></ul>



<p>Our tool of choice is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, which provides an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html">easy-to-undestand syntax</a> and a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html">massive selection of providers</a> (services you can describe in your code). In particular, the AWS integration is very complete.</p>



<p>Terraform makes documenting our (fairly complex) infrastructure really easy, and making changes to it easier still. Being part of our codebase and full CI/CD pipeline, it&#8217;s also very easy to automatically test changes and know when something&#8217;s wrong.</p>



<p>As well as setting up our service, the wider OPG team uses Terraform to manage our GitHub and AWS accounts. So when a new member of staff joins a team, their access is granted via a pull request and we can be confident they have the same access as their colleagues.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still a beginner with Terraform and Infrastructure as code, but I&#8217;m quickly seeing the power and confidence it brings.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Implemented the switch from Gulp to Webpack with very litle excitement</li><li>Finished development on our new cookie page: we&#8217;re planning to adopt a consistent approach across OPG&#8217;s public-facing services and it&#8217;s nice to lead the way</li><li>Developed a new framework for analytics/metrics in Complete the deputy report: this will make it easier for us to measure the value/impact of our work going forward<ul><li>This is the first time I&#8217;ve built something from a fresh prototype in a long time, which was very satisfying: no last minute questions or surprises</li></ul></li><li>Saw a great demo from our designer about redoing the admin pages, in part using the <a href="https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/">MOJ Design System</a>; I&#8217;ve also been looking at how to move from our custom CSS components to the MOJDS elsewhere</li><li>Spent most of Friday fixing a pipeline issue with our infrastructure, which was fully resolved at 17:15 &#x1f4aa;</li></ul>

<p>This week I decided to try keeping weeknotes.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>



<ul><li>I want to practice writing prose more</li><li>I want to step back and think about what I&#8217;ve done each week</li><li>It seems to be a hip trend and I&#8217;m a sucker for trends (particularly when I can own the data!)</li></ul>



<p>My key priority this week was introduced on Monday and resolved on Friday: implementing cross-domain analytics in our public-facing services. There&#8217;s been a lot of conversation about this in the media recently, and I won&#8217;t go into it, but it&#8217;s worth noting that this doesn&#8217;t cover any more information than we were already using.</p>



<p>Beyond that I&#8217;ve been supporting colleagues with the implementation of our new permissions model for Deputy Reporting. This has been a long process, because we&#8217;re working with an existing app with lots of active users and we can&#8217;t get in their way. We&#8217;re working on the final issues now though, and hopefully will have the core functionality in production next week.</p>



<p>At the end of the week, I started moving our build system from <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>. This has meant restructuring lots of our assets, which is ultimately a good thing, but a little more change than I would have liked. I think ultimately I have to dive in and not be scared to mix things up.</p>



<h2>Format</h2>



<p>As I understand it there isn&#8217;t really an agreed format for weeknotes, but I like to have a structure in things like this. It makes it wasier to write, read and compare.</p>



<p>Each weeknote will start with &#8220;This week I&#8230;&#8221; where I&#8217;ll give a headline about the key things I&#8217;ve done.</p>



<p>That&#8217;ll be followed by a general overview of the week: some common themes or just things I want to remember.</p>



<p>After the overview I&#8217;m reserving some space to dive into a topic more deeply. This section might include technical areas I&#8217;ve explored, some delivery practices we&#8217;ve trialled or something in policy that&#8217;s taken my interest.</p>



<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll end with a little bullet-point list of single sentences covering all the little things I&#8217;ve done during the week.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Updated our Google Analytics reporting to supply centralised data to GDS</li><li>Prototyped how we can improve our Cookie settings to give maximum clarity and flexibility to users</li><li>Investigated how much money we could save by switching Serve OPG to a Serverless Postgres database or DynamoDB (a lot!)</li><li>Started switching Deputy Reporting to Webpack</li><li>Supported colleagues in implementing new permissions structure in Deputy Reporting</li><li>Started writing weeknotes, hopefully I&#8217;ll get better at them soon!</li></ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/">Sporcle</a>. It&#8217;s a quiz website which is entirely user-submitted, meaning there&#8217;s a really wide array of quizzes on a variety of subjects. Subjects like <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/gb271/goalsforcfc?t=soccer">Fernando Torres&#8217;s 2010/11 goal record</a> or <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/gwukelic/i_dont_think_george_washington_is_going_to_make_it_on_this_quiz?t=politics">US President birth states</a>.</p>



<p>Part of my love of Sporcle is its simplicity. It harkens back to the early internet: where sites were run for love and not profit, where users provided data because they <em>wanted</em> to, where creating an account was an option rather than a requirement.</p>



<p>That Web 1.0 simplicity aludes to the fact that Sporcle is totally independent. Unlike many of the big websites , it&#8217;s not a subsidiary of Amazon or Google, it&#8217;s not owned by some umbrella corporation. Parent company Sporcle Inc. has three offices, <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/triviacon/">a conference</a> and <a href="https://www.haymakerpublichouse.com/">a bar</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure what Sporcle&#8217;s profitability model looks like (I assume it&#8217;s mostly ad-based) and maybe that&#8217;s dissuaded potential buyers. But, like many recent acquisitions, I think its real value is the data.</p>



<h2>Feeding the beast</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, Sporcle&#8217;s quizzes are all written by users. Some of these are spur of the moment or strangely specific, others are generic, popular and well-maintained.</p>



<p>Take, for example, the quizzes to name <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/disneyanimatedmovies">every Disney movie</a> or <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/presidents">every president</a>. Both of these quizzes ultimately contain structured and maintained data which is useful for many data-driven companies. Voice assistant questions like &#8220;when was Aladdin released&#8221; and &#8220;who was President in 1932&#8221; are answerable on tap.</p>



<p>Users are readily submitting and maintaining this information for others&#8217; enjoyment, and that value could be multiplied by a savvy tech company (at a very real reputational risk).</p>



<h2>Beasting the feed</h2>



<p>Using user-submitted data for new purposes is cool, but I&#8217;m more interested in the inverse. Voice assistants can already answer those questions today, the data is already available, so can we reverse the process to turn that <em>into</em> a quiz?</p>



<p>At its simplest level, this could be taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Categories">Wikipedia categories</a> and turning them into simple how-many-can-you-name quizzes. For that specific purpose, I&#8217;m pleased to announce <a href="https://spork-hell.glitch.me/"><strong>Spork Hell</strong></a>, my first attempt at generative quizzing.</p>



<p>Spork Hell finds a Wikipedia category at random (<em>completely</em> at random, which can produce interesting results) and asks you how many member pages you can list.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2019/08/imagen-625x326.png" alt="Quiz asking players to name &quot;County seats in California&quot;. There are 58 possible answers, but only three have been identified so far." class="wp-image-1507" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2019/08/imagen-625x326.png 625w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2019/08/imagen-300x156.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2019/08/imagen.png 746w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></figure>



<p>Spork Hell is random, variously interesting and consistently hard. I think it perfectly captures the amazing possibilities and serious challenges of generative quizzing.</p>



<p><em>I also made <a href="https://spork-hell-lists.glitch.me/">a version of Spork Hell</a> which uses Wikipedia&#8217;s &#8220;List of&#8230;&#8221; pages which is even more random and way more challenging to implement.</em></p>



<h2>Structured data</h2>



<p>So far I&#8217;ve only looked at &#8220;flat&#8221; data: I take a list of items and just replay them back to the user. I&#8217;d like to take this further and generate quizzes from structured data, which would allow much more complex quizzes and massively swell the number of possibilities.</p>



<p>As a basic example: imagine I have some basic information on countries, cities and which country each city is in. Some quizzes I could extract are (square brackets represent variables):</p>



<ul><li>Name the capital cities of the world</li><li>Name the capital cities within [100 miles] of [London]</li><li>List the largest cities in [Poland] in order</li><li>Name the capital cities with less than [60,000] population</li><li>Name the countries with at least one megacity</li></ul>



<p>Not only could I manually extract these quizzes, but I think I could reasonably expect a computer program to do so for me just by looking at the data available.</p>



<p>New data would then lead to many more possibilities: adding language information could make quizzes like &#8220;Name the most populous [German] speaking countries&#8221;; economic information could give us &#8220;Name the biggest exporters of [bananas]&#8221;.</p>



<p>And all of this can be further subdivided into more specific quizzes:</p>



<ul><li>Name the biggest [TV] exporting countries in [Western Europe]</li><li>Name the [French] speaking capital cities within [1000 miles] of [Paris]</li></ul>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d hope that a computer program would continue to generate the weird stuff.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Hopefully this is the first in a series of posts of playing with generative quizzing, but for now please enjoy my early, extremely challenging attempts:</p>

<p>I was in an exercise at work recently which involved visualising our last two weeks as a game of snakes and ladders: we drew a game board and labelled the ladders with things that had helped us progress, the snakes were things that hindered. (Sound like a good idea? <a href="https://jobs.jobvite.com/justicedigitalandtechnology">We&#8217;re hiring!</a>)</p>



<p>During this exercise I had a minor, irrelevant realization that the game of Snakes and Ladders was simply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite-state machine</a> with randomly-selected transitions. If you&#8217;re on square 17, you will always go to square 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23 if you roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 respectively. If you land on a square with a snake or ladder, you instantly transition to its other end.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also been thinking recently about how Choose Your Own Adventure books (which are apparently properly called &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook">gamebooks</a>&#8220;) are <em>also</em> finite-state machines. From any one page in the gamebook, your transition options are finite and clearly defined.</p>



<p>Neither of these are particularly insightful observations, they&#8217;re just different ways of thinking about representation and codification. When you work with software, you think about this a lot (I&#8217;ve also been thinking about how to codify recipes recently).</p>



<p>The upshot of this is that I created a Choose Your Own Adventure style <a href="https://lovely-serpent.glitch.me/"><strong>Snakes and Ladders game</strong></a>. It&#8217;s predictable, repetitive and relies completely on chance (as the original). I also think it&#8217;s strangely charming and I&#8217;d like to publish a physical copy sometime—I just need some cover art.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Sunday, the Shanghai Dragons won the Stage 3 playoffs of the 2019 Overwatch League—and $500,000 prize money—in a nail-biting series against the San Francisco Shock.</p>



<p>The playoff win concludes a marked comeback for the Dragons, who last year did not count a single win among their 40 matches in the 2018 season. The Shock meanwhile put in a strong showing after a difficult stage, but the loss denotes a fall-in-grace for the reigning champions.</p>



<p>Overwatch League&#8217;s playoff finals are played in a &#8220;first to four&#8221; system, meaning final series can run to anything between three and seven maps. At the end of Stage 3, fans were treated to all seven.</p>



<h2>Match summary</h2>



<p>The Dragons started off strong, taking the first three maps confidently. San Francisco Shock seemed unable to counter the Dragons&#8217; now characteristic wide hero pool, a stark contrast to the team compositions the Shock have been used to competing against.</p>



<p>But, after the Shock snatched a victory on the fourth map, Havana, the tables started to turn. Nerves settling, and finding a few new heros of their own,  the Shock came back with a newfound strength and clear demonstration of why they held the Stage 2 crown.</p>



<p>The Shock then faced an uphill battle, however. Per playoff rules, the losing team of each map gets to pick the next. The Dragons were now permanently just one map away from victory, and they would be picking every one (though it should be noted that the Dragons had already faced this challenge in their own victories earlier).</p>



<p>San Francisco Shock went on to take a second map, and a third, and the two teams entered the final map, Dorado, with three-a-piece. Whoever won the map would take the series, and the stage.</p>



<p>The Shock were first to play and, after an almighty defence by the Dragons, managed to only scrape up a single control point. The Dragons then had a clear goal to win, but between them and the prize money were the reigning champions, themselves now comfortable on unusual heroes.</p>



<p>The Shock put up another excellent defence, and until the dying moments it really was unclear whether the Dragons could do it. But with some clutch rockets from Dding and sniping from Diem, they managed to push the cart just a little further than their rivals and take it all.</p>



<h2>Players of note</h2>



<p>With many DPS and diving characters in play, there was a lot of opportunity for impressive individual play in the playoff final. Whereas previous stages have relied on tight team cooperation, this series let individuals shine with surprise maneuvers and careful hero control.</p>



<p>On the side of the Shanghai Dragons, Dding surely must be mentioned first. Playing as Pharah, he controlled the air and launched rockets down at his opponents beneath. Keeping this pressure up from unusual angles, this gave his teammates the opportunities needed to break their defence (and Dding himself picked up plenty of kills).</p>



<p>Diem must also be congratulated for his contribution to the Dragons&#8217; win. Playing his signature Widowmaker he provided incredible value-for-bullet, picking off the Shock&#8217;s support players and pressuring their tanks. When forced to play Sombra, he continued to control the battlefield and provide his team with the tools necessary to win.</p>



<p>Finally for the Dragons, Youngjin played the role of crowd-pleaser. As Doomfist he made some incredible individual contributions, disrupting the Shock frontlines and using all of the hero&#8217;s abilities with precision.</p>



<p>For the San Francisco Shock, attention must be payed to ChoiHyoBin. Recognised as one off the—if not <em>the</em>—best D. Va player in the League, Choi spent much of the finals instead playing Roadhog. As well as making fine use of Roadhog&#8217;s damage-dealing-and-taking abilities Choi drew amazement at his hook precision, pulling opponents out of the air and from backlines at essential moments. On that performance alone, expect to see more Roadhog in Stage 4.</p>



<h2>A last hurrah?</h2>



<p>As well as being a heartwarming and thrilling comeback story, the Dragons&#8217; win is already an important part of the Overwatch League&#8217;s history: it almost certainly indicates a turning point in the team compositions we can expect to see.</p>



<p>For the last year, top-flight competitive has been dominated by a hero composition of three tank heroes and three support heroes, a tactic known as &#8220;three-three&#8221; or &#8220;GOATS&#8221; (Greatest Of All Time). This composition has been a key to San Francisco&#8217;s success, as they are probably the best three-three team in the league.</p>



<p>Throughout Stage 3, we&#8217;ve started to see the three-three composition under threat. First, by the &#8220;Sombra variation&#8221;, in which the DPS hero Sombra (who can hack others to disable their powers) was brought in to either punish the tightly-packed three-three team, or threaten them to spread out.</p>



<p>Soon after that, the &#8220;Phar-Mercy&#8221; composition became popular. This introduced the flying heroes Pharah and Mercy, who together could deal a lot of rocket damage from above. Again, this forced opponents to spread out to ensure they didn&#8217;t all suffer splash damage from the same rockets.</p>



<p>Other counters and compositions emerged, with varying success. The &#8220;Bunker&#8221; composition was popular earlier in the stage (and its delightfully named variant, the &#8220;Pirate Ship&#8221;); heroes like Orisa and Hanzo saw serious stage time; Ana was introduced by many as an explicit defence against Sombra.</p>



<p>Throughout all of this though, three-three was never truly unseated and remained a common composition for many. Not as dominant, almost always with variation, but still an essential part of the game.</p>



<p>The Stage 3 finals may have finally put a symbolic stop to the composition, showing that even the best three-three team in the world cannot compete with a more diverse and complex line-up. The Shanghai Dragons have demonstrated, on the biggest stage of the year so far, that three-three can be beaten.</p>



<p>However, a symbolic defeat may not be what puts an end to three-three. Rumours have abound for months now that Blizzard will be introducing a composition lock: every team must use two tank, two support and two DPS heroes.</p>



<p>With this lock anticipated for Stage 4, seeing three-three defeated in the final match of Stage 3 will bring joy to its critics.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>For various reasons, Stage 3 of the Overwatch League 2019 Season has been its most exciting yet. Compositions have started to be upheaved; favourite players have moved on, and new ones have become celebrities.</p>



<p>Perhaps most notably, Stage 3 has seen various teams rise and fall. LA Valiant and Houston Outlaws each took 5 of their 8 wins of the season in Stage 3. Atlanta Reign took just two.</p>



<p>The Stage 3 playoffs provided the perfect conclusion to a topsy-turvey season. Shanghai Dragons, after a disastrous 2018 season, entered the playoffs as the lowest-ranked team. Yet, on their journey to victory, they defeated the Stage 1 and Stage 2 champions.</p>



<p>Shanghai&#8217;s win is incredibly important to them, but it&#8217;s also important to the League. It represents a changing of the guard, a new opportunity for teams who&#8217;ve previously been discounted. And, with the final stage of the year just around the corner, we can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next.</p>



<p><em>Overwatch League&#8217;s Stage 4—the final stage of the season—starts on 24th July with the Houston Outlaws taking on Paris Eternal.</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>More and more companies are providing services rather than products, creating an enduring relationship for customers who buy into the brand. What impact does the have?</em></p>
<p>As a company, selling a service is often much more profitable than selling a product. For example, a £100 sale is great, but a service charging £10 a month for a year will net you more income.</p>
<p>As such, many things that we would typically buy are now available as services: you can get monthly subscriptions for clothes, groceries, entertainment and toiletries. These subscriptions often cost consumers more and contribute to growing global problems of negative equity.</p>
<p>They also create a much closer relationship between business and consumer. Whilst traditional grocery purchasing gives you the opportunity to try different stores and shop around, subscription services lock you in to a provider.</p>
<p>These relationships, far from side effects, are the entire point of offering services rather than products. Service providers&#8217; successes are dependent on tie-in, and they will try their hardest to make it difficult for you to leave.</p>
<p>This model of ever-closer relationships between supplier and consumer extend into other industries too. Video games have gone from being one-time purchases, to having downloadable content, to micro-transactions to the new &#8220;season&#8221; format.</p>
<p>In this format, video games typically release new content with each season, potentially changing the game drastically. Whilst on the surface that content is free for everyone, most of it requires purchasing a &#8220;season pass&#8221;. This becomes a subscription-like situation: players pay every season for new content and features.</p>
<p>The twist here is that seasons increasingly make it difficult to opt out. Certain features often require an upgrade, or are realistically unplayable without the additional content from the season pass. Notably, once you stop paying the season pass you stop having access to things you&#8217;d already paid for.</p>
<p>This brings us to &#8220;smart&#8221; products: home devices connected to WiFi to provide extra functionality. A promise of these devices is that they can update &#8220;over the air&#8221; and you&#8217;ll have access to new features without having to pay for a physical upgrade.</p>
<p>The issue here is that those virtual updates will only work for as long as the company provides them. As with computers and phones, eventually your device will fall out of favour and stop receiving updates. This &#8220;end of life&#8221; can often fall sooner than the expected life of non-smart alternative.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really unlucky, a bodged update or a change in business can make your product unusable. As with video game season passes, you can lose access to something you&#8217;ve already paid for at the whim of the provider.</p>
<p>All of this didn&#8217;t used to happen. I have video games from twenty years ago that I can still play all of. My kettle will work until the parts break, and I can probably replace them. But there&#8217;s an increasing trend to subscriptions, seasons and smarts, and it&#8217;s all made out to look like a benefit to consumers.</p>
<p>If you want to buy a new TV, it&#8217;s hard to find one which isn&#8217;t &#8220;smart&#8221;. You&#8217;re forced to pay the premium for features you might not want and the additional risk of the firmware breaking (not to mention the privacy violations).</p>
<p>We need to break the cycle on this. We&#8217;re becoming increasingly dependent on businesses staying afloat, and paying much more for the privilege. Subscriptions are masking the actual cost of services. We&#8217;re losing our grip on ownership.</p>
<p>If you want to buy something, try to just buy it. Avoid the additional features you don&#8217;t need, avoid the spyware, avoid the stretched-out payments that will cost you more. Avoid the promise of more stuff, avoid the &#8220;ongoing updates&#8221; which could stop at any time, avoid things which randomly need WiFi.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about refactoring recently (rewriting functional code to improve its quality, security, legibility etc.), particularly in relation to some projects I&#8217;ve been working on. This morning a <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090860150712221698">twitter thread by Sarah Mei (@sarahmei)</a> caught my attention and I thought I should finally write something on the subject.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll come back to Sarah&#8217;s thread throughout this post, but it&#8217;s well worth a read and takes a different angle to what I&#8217;m about to say. My main talking point from it is that incremental refactoring is essential to a healthly project, and we don&#8217;t need to make massive changes all the time. But she also talks excellently on analysis and communication.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>To actually fix it, you need to negotiate with the individuals who are  applying the pressure [to not refactor]. You need to understand THEIR incentives, and align your desired changes with those. </p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090885026785284096">Sarah Mei (@sarahmei)</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2>Bad code</h2>



<p>Like many (most?) developers, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time with &#8220;bad code&#8221;, most of which I&#8217;ve written myself. This is code that I know to not be high quality, and that I understand needs to be refactored. But I want to identify first what makes code &#8220;bad&#8221; and why we put up with it.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a category of bad code which is just poorly written, perhaps because of laziness or lack of skill. But that&#8217;s a tiny proportion of most of the code I&#8217;ve ever refactored. In my experience, most bad code was fine when it was originally written but has since turned sour, for a variety of reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Perhaps <strong>best practices has moved on</strong> and what <em>was</em> best practice is now bad practice</li><li>Perhaps <strong>the scope has changed</strong> and what was a small throwaway feature has become a fundamental part of an application</li><li>Perhaps <strong>you originally made a rough proof-of-concept</strong> and it&#8217;s been blindly embedded into a real-world application</li><li>Perhaps <strong>dependencies have been upgraded</strong> and you&#8217;re using a package which is missing key features or, worse, isn&#8217;t being supported</li><li>Perhaps <strong>you&#8217;ve found a better way of doing things</strong> and you&#8217;re suddenly aware that the code could be faster, smaller or more pure</li><li>Perhaps <strong>your code has become insecure</strong> due to a vulnerability being discovered, or processing power evolving to make brute force attacks possible</li></ul>



<p>All of these circumstances can be mitigated slightly with good preparation, but I think it&#8217;s naive to think of them as completely avoidable. Writing web applications is a constant stream of being blindsided by technology, market trends and user needs. So, at some point, your code will become bad and need to be refactored.</p>



<h2>Recent experiences</h2>



<p>I want to talk a bit about my experience lately and where I believe I went wrong. Then I&#8217;ll talk a bit about what I&#8217;ve learnt from the experience and what I&#8217;ll do to avoid it happening again on my next project.</p>



<p>About six months ago I picked up a new front-end project, based on React and Redux. The project was started a couple of years back, and has been intermittently worked on since, but I believe I was the first developer to really start looking at it on a day-to-day basis with the vision to release it to customers.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re already seeing the red flags, then you did a better job than me. I picked up the project, got a feel for how it worked, and started implementing new features. Refactoring didn&#8217;t really cross my mind.</p>



<p>What I missed was that the project was littered with bad code. And let me clarify again that this wasn&#8217;t because of anyone who worked on it previously, it was because:</p>



<ul><li>The project had been started two years ago</li><li>It had only been worked on intermittently</li></ul>



<p>Two years had been a long time for the React ecosystem, and best practices had moved on significantly. The project had been started from a popular-at-the-time template which structured code and used packages in a way that is now discouraged (I tracked down the original template, which explains it is now deprecated and not recommended).</p>



<p>Over the course of two years, work hadn&#8217;t been properly planned or scheduled (the application was effectively a prototype during this time) so new features were introduced sporadically and inconsistently. With the time constraints this is excusable, but it left the application fragmented.</p>



<p>Ultimately, coming into the project in mid-2018, the code was inconsistent and didn&#8217;t match any reference sources online (since documentation is updated to reflect current best practies) and a lot of the dependencies were out-of-date. Some of those dependencies could be upgraded quite easily, but some (for example, upgrading React Router from version 2 to 4) required complete code changes.</p>



<h2>Lessons learned</h2>



<p>A little while into the project I started to appreciate the scale of refactoring required and quickly pushed the thought from my mind because it was &#8220;too big&#8221;. I had features to implement, deadlines to meet, and I didn&#8217;t have time to rewrite data architecture (a scarily impactful change!).</p>



<p>But reality shortly set in. Some features <em>required</em> packages to be upgraded, and documenting a system which mixed old and new techniques was becoming a nightmare. I started to pick a few battles and refactor the application as-and-when I came to problem areas. In effect, I was starting to read the advice I saw from Sarah today:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Improvement</p><p>Over</p><p>Consistency. </p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090875259731890177">Sarah Mei (@sarahmei)</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Six months into the project, there&#8217;s been a lot of improvement. Our usage of Redux is (mostly) clean and consistent, we&#8217;re starting to build up a component library, ESLint is strict and passing, and this week our React Router dependency got upgraded to version 4.</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s still a lot to do: there&#8217;s some data duplication across Redux stores, directory structure is unintuitive and there&#8217;s a 2000+ line component that I&#8217;m dreading having to tackle.</p>



<p>As I see it, incremental improvement to the application was the only way to keep this project working. Avoiding these small refactors would have led to a slower, harder to develop application; a large refactor would have meant throwing out a lot of our good work and delaying the project. Instead, we have a <em>functional</em>, <em>better</em> but <em>imperfect</em> codebase, happy clients and a good vision for future work.</p>



<p>Improvement over consistency.</p>



<h2>Planning refactoring</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m well aware of the mistakes I made on this project. I didn&#8217;t acknowledge the need to refactor quick enough, didn&#8217;t communicate this to my colleagues and managers, and didn&#8217;t suitably plan how I would perform the refactoring. So, as ever, let&#8217;s make this a learning opportunity. What will I do differently next time?</p>



<p>Firstly, I&#8217;ll make sure I <strong>properly assess bad code</strong> when taking over new projects or at regular intervals when working on my own. There&#8217;s no shame in acknowledging that code falls out-of-date and identifying where improvements can be made.</p>



<p>However, I&#8217;ll be careful in this process not to over-estimate the bad code. It&#8217;s easy to get carried away and insist on making sweeping changes which won&#8217;t actually help (e.g. migrating to the hottest new tool when your existing one works and is actively supported).</p>



<p>Assessing the bad code will also involve <strong>writing a report</strong> about my findings. I&#8217;ll identify the <em>isolated</em> areas of the code which need to be refactored, make suggestions about how they can be improved, and provide options for how that might be approached.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll <strong>share the report with colleagues</strong> to raise awareness of the problems and indicate what additional work might need to be prioritised. They may be able to suggest solutions they&#8217;ve adopted in the past, or identify other projects which could benefit from the same refactoring.</p>



<p>Doing this proper analysis and report writing will ensure that I&#8217;m aware of the refactoring opportunities, and can properly plan for how to enact them. When I have capacity, or am working in a related area, I can refer to my report to pick up the additional refactoring work without having to do all the analysis again.</p>



<h2>Communicating refactoring</h2>



<p>Finally, I wanted to end with a brief note about how to ensure that you suitably communicate the importance of refactoring. In the introduction I suggested that refactoring involves rewriting &#8220;functional code&#8221; (which isn&#8217;t high quality), and people can often balk at this idea: if the code is functional, why waste our time rewriting it when we have other things to work on?</p>



<p>Again, Sarah&#8217;s Twitter thread covers this very well.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There’s almost always a win-win in there SOMEWHERE. You can start by   trying to understand what is driving that desire for them. It might not   be what you think.  </p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090888376926892033">Sarah Mei (@sarahmei)</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Refactoring will often bring tangible improvements: faster, smaller, fewer errors, looks nicer. If these match with your colleague&#8217;s/manager&#8217;s/company&#8217;s priorities, then you have a great opportunity to sell the benefits and get buy-in.</p>



<p>But some refactoring isn&#8217;t like that. It can have other reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Using an old version of a depedency may <em>work</em> but it won&#8217;t be supported if something goes wrong</li><li>Outdated or complex code is hard for new starts to understand</li><li>Old technology is battle-tested, but hard to recruit for</li><li>Inconsistent code is confusing, and damages developers&#8217; cognitive load</li><li>Complex code may work, but it&#8217;s fragile</li></ul>



<p>Importantly, all of these reasons to refactor can save time and money in the future because they allow you to mitigate against anticipated problems. So whilst code might not be causing you problems <em>right now</em>, spending a few hours to refactor something today might save you five days, apologetic emails and wasted money in six months time.</p>



<p>Ultimately, when agitating for refactoring, you need to make sure you know <em>why</em> it&#8217;s a good idea, and that you can sell that to your team. Identify the reasons, calculate the impact, and explain your strategy to mitigate.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Allow me to finish with one final plug for <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1090860150712221698">Sarah&#8217;s Twitter thread</a>. It covers a lot more topics than I go into here (I&#8217;m writing this to selfishly talk about my work) in a thoughtful and practical way. If this post was interesting to you, Sarah&#8217;s thread certainly will be too!</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Removing third-party dependencies]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>An explanation of how—and why—I removed third-party dependencies on fonts and analytics from this website</p>
]]></description>

      <dc:creator>Greg Tyler</dc:creator>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently decided to remove all third-party dependencies from most of my websites. That is, all scripts, CSS and fonts that are loaded from a server other than *.gregtyler.co.uk</p>
<p>My primary concern is user privacy. Whenever you visit a site with a third-party dependency, that third-party is aware of your visit. So even if you don&#8217;t click &#8220;like&#8221; on a page that features the Facebook button its mere presence—and the network request to load it—inform Facebook that you&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>This site and others I run, like <a href="https://talklikeapoirotday.co.uk/">Talk Like a Poirot Day</a>, might not feature the sort of content you&#8217;d be too worried about third-parties knowing about your visit to; but the cumulative knowledge of visitors&#8217; viewing habits is the stuff of dystopian science fiction.</p>
<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>
<p>Facebook is an easy target here, but the real threat on my sites is Google through its <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">analytics tools</a>.</p>
<p>Analytics is the process of tracking users&#8217; visits to a website and then assessing them en masse to determine meaningful patterns which can help inform website development. For example, I&#8217;m aware that my articles on <a href="http://localhost:4141/webdev/ssl-read-errno-10054">an SSL error</a> and on <a href="http://localhost:4141/webdev/vuejs-browserify-grunt">using Vue with Browersify and Grunt</a> are much more popular than other content I&#8217;ve produced, so I might focus more on those fields in the future to improve my impact.</p>
<p>Google Analytics is the industry standard for analytics. It&#8217;s a powerful, optimised product which makes it easy to analyse very small and very large sites. It&#8217;s easy to setup, easy to use, and completely free.</p>
<p>However, every visit tracked by Google Analytics is sent to and stored on Google&#8217;s servers. And, with an <a href="https://www.similartech.com/categories/analytics">estimated market share of nearly two thirds</a>, Google can realistically track people&#8217;s movement across most of the web.</p>
<p><strong>Important disclaimer:</strong> Google somewhat anonymises visitors, and you&#8217;re treated as a different person on each website you visit. However, if they wanted to, Google could still easily fingerprint you between sessions and track you as a single entity.</p>
<p><strong>Important disclaimer 2:</strong> Even if Google <em>were</em> doing this (which they may or may not be), there&#8217;s no reason to believe they&#8217;re doing anything nefarious with the information.</p>
<p>Disclaimers aside though, the mere possibility is a troubling prospect to me.</p>
<h2 id="attack-vector">Attack vector</h2>
<p>As well as notifying hosts of user activity, third-party dependencies produce a significant attack vector because they can change. Whilst a table-sorting script might do the job perfectly when you include it, a bad actor could in the future change that code to steal your users&#8217; data, redirect them to a phishing site, or mine BitCoin using their computer.</p>
<p>In fact that last event happened <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/11/browsealoud_compromised_coinhive/">just yesterday</a> on thousands of government, healthcare and educational sites when a third-party script to aid accessibility was compromised (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-javascript-supply-chain-paradox-sri-csp-and-trust-in-third-party-libraries/">Troy Hunt</a> and <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/protect-site-from-cryptojacking-csp-sri/">Scott Helme</a> give this an excellent in-depth technical write-up).</p>
<p>Again, I should caveat that the chance of this happening to third-party juggernauts like Google or Facebook is extremely low. And that it&#8217;s quite easily avoided with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">sub-resource integrity</a> or <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content-security-policy-an-introduction/">content security policy</a>. But it&#8217;s worth being aware the threats.</p>
<h2 id="matomo">Matomo</h2>
<p>Enter <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a> (formerly Piwik). Matomo is an independent, open-source, self-hosted analytics platform. It works in the same way as Google Analytics but is not quite as polished and charges for many of the features that Google doesn&#8217;t. Most importantly though, you can host your own instance.</p>
<p>And so it is that my Matomo installation is on <a href="https://analytics.gregtyler.co.uk/">analytics.gregtyler.co.uk</a> so every time you visit this or one of my other sites, a notification is sent there and anonymously stored, and I can analyse trends to guide future content.</p>
<p>When I say anonymously, I mean this: Matomo tracks the pages you visit, and the city you&#8217;re in, but otherwise it tracks and I know nothing more about your identity. Your IP address is trimmed in half before being saved (like with credit card numbers on receipts), so I couldn&#8217;t try and trace you backwards even if I wanted to (whereas Google, Facebook etc. could).</p>
<p>Matomo also supports <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track">Do Not Track</a>, a setting you can turn on in your browser to opt out of these sort of automated tracking processes. If you don&#8217;t want to be counted amongst these kind of statistics, I <em>highly</em> recommend turning it on (<a href="http://donottrack.us/">you can find instructions here</a>), though know that websites can freely ignore it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be ignorant to not note the trade-off here. Whilst your browsing habits are now free of Google, your localised ones have fallen to me. And their security, once kept by a tech giant with teams dedicated to it, is now in my hands.</p>
<p>That said, nothing has ever been stopping me, or any other random website, from tracking you privately anyway. Dropping Google Analytics at least gives you respite from one source. And with the isolated nature of your data (i.e. only tracking my own site) and the anonymity provided by Matomo, I see this as a much better solution for privacy rights.</p>
<h3 id="installing-matomo">Installing Matomo</h3>
<p>For those interested more in the technical side of using Matomo, let me briefly note that it&#8217;s pretty easy as long as you&#8217;re running a LAMP server. The documentation on the website provides an <a href="https://matomo.org/docs/installation/">easy install guide</a>, followed by a step-by-step wizard to connect things up.</p>
<p>At the end you get a script similar to the one Google Analytics provides which is an easy drop in replacement, as you can see from <a href="https://github.com/gregtyler/Palomar/commit/056c6fb9cda969eb60008ab4a2da93f46d8e7238">the commit</a> that switched this website around.</p>
<p>However, setting up geolocation for Matomo is more difficult. It&#8217;s quite a manual process, particularly if using PHP7 because you then need to compile the PECL extension yourself. I had a few stumbling blocks here, and I wouldn&#8217;t feel qualified providing much advice to anyone else struggling. But I would note that you need geoip-beta, a piece of information I found squirreled away on a mailing list.</p>
<p>If you can live without geolocation, Matomo will do you proud from the off. If you can&#8217;t, I recommend making sure you&#8217;re comfortable with the command line, devops and your server. It&#8217;s not a casual install, and getting it wrong has potential to signficantly break your server.</p>
<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
<p>The other major third-party dependency I purged was fonts. This website previously used <a href="http://www.opensans.com/">Open Sans</a> and <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Titillium">Titillium Web</a>, both loaded from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">Google Fonts</a>. Again, I had concerns with every visitor letting Google know of their presence here by loading the font.</p>
<p>Like Google Analytics, Google Fonts is an excellent service. It&#8217;s fast, easy-to-use and free. Font loading is a difficult topic in web development and Google&#8217;s service really makes it a breeze. With the complexity ahead, I balked slightly at having to figuring out a replacement for myself.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a <a href="https://medium.design/system-shock-6b1dc6d6596f">growing</a> <a href="http://markdotto.com/2018/02/07/github-system-fonts/">trend</a> recently of using <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/">system fonts</a>. That is, the default fonts that come with your computer or phone. This approach makes website look more native, improves performance (by removing the font-loading overhead), and protects against browser bugs (again, by simply removing the opportunity).</p>
<p>Mostly the system font approach is used by sites which want to seem like &#8220;apps&#8221;. They want to lose the shackles of looking like a web interface and feel natural and at home on a user&#8217;s computer or, more likely, phone.</p>
<p>Admittedly, gregtyler.co.uk does not want to appear like an app. You can&#8217;t even comment. Or search. There isn&#8217;t an input box on the site. But for that performance boost, and to stop me worrying about fonts, I took the leap and I think it looks pretty good.</p>
<p>As I continue to remove third-party dependencies from other sites, this choice won&#8217;t last. I love the pleasure that custom fonts add to <a href="https://cv.gregtyler.co.uk/">my CV</a>, and <a href="https://talklikeapoirotday.co.uk/">Talk Like a Poirot Day</a> simply wouldn&#8217;t look the same in Segoe UI or Helvetica. Watch this space for details on how I choose to deal with those.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Turning off third-party dependencies feels a bit like &#8220;going dark&#8221;. This website is now an island, free of connections to the outside internet. Whether visitors notice it or not, <em>I</em> feel more comfortable knowing that their browsing habits aren&#8217;t being shared elsewhere.</p>
<p>Switching to Matomo has been really easy, and so far the information coming out is exactly what I need. And whilst switching to system fonts was a bit of a cop out, I&#8217;m really happy with how that has turned out.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve just got to go back to every other site I&#8217;ve developed or hosted and continue the switch.</p>

      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2017 13:13:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js&#39;s</a> Single File Components are great: they&#39;re easy to use, easy to share and satisfying to work with. There are lots of tutorials online about how to use them, and plenty too about how to build them using various build tools (Webpack, Rollup, Gulp&#8230;). However, I struggled to find a good guide to building Single File Components with Grunt and Browserify, so I thought I&#39;d write one.</p>
<p>I should start by saying that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend using Grunt and/or Browserify. There&#39;s nothing wrong with them, but they wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. However, they&#39;re what we use in my current job so they&#39;re what I implemented Vue with.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also going to assume that you&#39;re familiar with Vue and its Single File Components.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools">The tools</h2>
<p><a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> is a programmable task runner that automates common processes. In the context of this tutorial, it automates the process of combining all of your component files into one to put them onto a server.</p>
<p><a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> is a build tool that allows you to use the <code>require</code> function (common in Node.js) to import other JavaScript files into the one you&#39;re currently using. In the context of Vue, it allows you to specify which other components are used within your current component.</p>
<h2 id="the-files">The files</h2>
<p>An example of a Vue Single File Component is shown below. Notice how it uses <code>require</code> to use another, smaller component. This file isn&#39;t much good on its own, so we want to use Grunt and Browserify to compile it into Vue and make it usable in our application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;colour-selector&quot;&gt;Select your colour, and click to continue&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select id=&quot;colour-selector&quot; v-model=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;&lt;option&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option&gt;Green&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option&gt;Blue&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;ActionButton icon=&quot;arrow-right&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/ActionButton&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
const ActionButton = require(&#39;./ActionButton.vue&#39;);

module.exports = {
  data: () =&gt; ({
    colour: &#39;Red&#39;
  }),
  components: {
    ActionButton
  }
};
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As well as your Vue components, you&#39;ll also need to have an <strong>entry file</strong>. This is a vanilla JavaScript file which requires and renders whatever your main root component is. This file also needs to require the <code>vue</code> NPM package so that all of Vue&#39;s functionality is included in the bundle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Vue = require(&#39;vue&#39;);

const App = require(&#39;./components/App.vue&#39;);

new Vue({
  el: &#39;#app&#39;,
  render: (createElement) =&gt; createElement(App)
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-npm-packages">The NPM packages</h2>
<p>We need four core packages to make this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>grunt</li>
<li>grunt-browserify</li>
<li>vueify</li>
<li>vue</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be installed through NPM with the command:<br />
<code>npm install --save-dev grunt grunt-browserify vueify vue</code></p>
<h2 id="the-grunt-file">The Grunt file</h2>
<p>The Grunt file is very simple, just pulling together the various things we&#39;ve installed. <code>src/index.js</code> is the entry file that we described above. Notice that we don&#39;t need to specify <em>any</em> component files: since they&#39;re required by either the entry file or a component that it requires, Browserify will automatically include them in the bundle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = function(grunt) {
  grunt.initConfig({
    browserify: {
      bundle: {
        src: &#39;index.js&#39;,
        dest: &#39;bundle.min.js&#39;
      },
      options: {
        browserifyOptions: {
          debug: true
        },
        transform: [
          [&#39;vueify&#39;]
        ]
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks(&#39;grunt-browserify&#39;);

  grunt.registerTask(&#39;build&#39;, function() {
    grunt.task.run(&#39;browserify&#39;);
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>With the Grunt file written, we just need to run <code>grunt build</code> in the command line (in the same directory as the file) and Grunt will use Browserify to generate a single file called <code>bundle.min.js</code> which you can put in your web application to render the Vue components you&#39;ve built.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>If you want to do more with Grunt, consider using <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> to check all of your code follows linting guidelines. And use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-ssh">grunt-ssh</a> to deploy your bundle onto your webserver.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend was the final of the <a href="https://eurovision.tv/">Eurovision Song Contest</a>. Eurovision is a cross-Europe (and beyond) singing competition in which each country nominates a singing act and they compete to find the continent&#39;s favourite. It&#39;s known for its fun factor, with countries often choosing visually impressive or otherwise unusual acts rather than their best singers.</p>
<p>The final event of Eurovision features the 26 winners of the semi-finals performing sequentially, followed by a public vote. The night finishes with each country revealing its citizens&#39; scores along with a panel of professional judges from the nation. With <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eurovision/entries/18aa5cc2-0f94-3882-9c57-07fdec46dc5b">political voting</a> and bad international link-ups, this is a great part of the night.</p>
<p>For the past few years I&#39;ve been to or hosted some sort of Eurovision party on the night, where everyone watches along, argues about their favourite acts, munches food and, lately, participates in some sort of Eurovision bingo.</p>
<p>Last year, a friend suggested building an app so everyone at the party could vote along on the night, with a screen in the room keeping track of the total score. It was too late notice at the time but this year, less than six hours before the broadcast started, I decided I could produce something quick enough.</p>
<p>I was also spurred on by recently playing a lot of <a href="http://jackboxgames.com/">Jackbox Games</a> products, which involve players in the room using their smartphone to play along with instructions on screen. I&#39;ve been meaning to try creating a similar game myself, and this seemed like a good stepping stone.</p>
<h2 id="feature-set">Feature set</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1157" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-app.png" alt="A screenshot of my Eurovision party voting app" width="452" height="699" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-app.png 452w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-app-194x300.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<p>The feature set of the app is pretty straightforward. When users open the website for the first time, they are asked for their name. They&#39;re then given a list of the evening&#39;s competitors and can select a score between 1 and 10 for each.</p>
<p>Once all the songs have been performed, players can switch across to the &quot;Points&quot; page and allocate points to their favourite songs, as if they&#39;re an entire European country to themselves. Like the real voting countries, players can select to give 12 points to their favourite song, 10 points to their second favourite, and then 8 through 1 points to the remaining 8 songs they enjoyed.</p>
<p>When players have finished allocating their points, they hit a big &quot;Save judgement&quot; button at the bottom of the screen to send their selections to my server. At the end of the voting period, I then run a script on the server to pull out our final votes.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-app-in-five-hours">Building an app in five hours</h2>
<p>When I introduced the app, people were impressed that I made it in only about five hours. <em>I</em> was surprised at the result, and repeatedly thought I wouldn&#39;t make the deadline. I did also have to miss the Spanish entry to fix a couple of bugs, but they came dead last so it seems I didn&#39;t miss much.</p>
<p>I credit the turnaround time mostly to simplicity. There&#39;s a lot of talk in the front-end development community about how involved starting a new project is: selecting a JavaScript framework, selecting what language to actually write in and transpile from, finding all the tools to hook the two up, and then installing everything through your package manager of choice.</p>
<p>Instead of going through that whole process, I just decided to use plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks, no dependencies. Everything was going to be client-side rendered, whilst using JSON files and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> instead of databases.</p>
<p>Admittedly I had some unusual benefits here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&#39;t have to worry about scalability beyond 20 people</li>
<li>All the players had a fairly recent smartphone with a fairly modern web browser</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly though, the second point is extremely often true of the target audience of new apps, and the scalability could easily have been handled with some minification-at-deployment and use of <a href="https://kosamari.com/notes/Service-Worker-what-are-you">Service Worker</a>.</p>
<p>I made a few other simplifying architectural decisions. I used John Resig&#39;s <a href="https://johnresig.com/blog/javascript-micro-templating/">extremely simple micro-templating function</a> for all templating. This function is quite limited in functionality (and safety) but was perfectly suitable for my use-case. I also decided to use the <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2015/thats-so-fetch/">Fetch API</a>, which is possibly my favourite web platform feature of the past couple of years. I included the <a href="https://github.com/github/fetch">GitHub fetch polyfill</a> in case anyone present didn&#39;t have quite the most modern of browsers and because it was easy.</p>
<p>Using these modern web platform features made development <em>extremely</em> easy. In moments I had client-side rendering templates based on a pre-prepared JSON file, with interactive elements that stored data in the client so would persist on refresh.</p>
<p>And, because I was storing the data on the client, the impact on my server was completely minimal. A few hits on initial page load, but no navigation and no need to refresh.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon I added the server-saving element, which was a single Node script hosted by nginx which would partially validate the submitted data and store it as a JSON file using the submitter&#39;s username. I used <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> to simplify routing and <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/">cors</a>, but the rest was pure Node.js JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-missing">What was missing</h2>
<p>There was one key feature I overlooked that pretty much everyone who played along pointed out to me: in contravention of Eurovision rules, everyone could vote for their own country. The UK, who were grossly over-represented at our party, didn&#39;t seem to benefit from that at all though.</p>
<p>There were some technical bits I would have liked to tidy up. Firstly, introducing Service Worker would have made this much more compelling. For those who closed their browsers or tab, they would be able to re-open the app instantly with no data usage. It could even have saved to home screen, which I think would&#39;ve made people feel more comfortable thinking of it as an &quot;app&quot; (though in the end no-one brought this up).</p>
<p>I also should have added more validation to the server-side. If anyone had wanted to, they could have submitted any number of points to any number of competitors. Again though, this wasn&#39;t really an issue because the only users were a room of 20 or so friends who had no interest in breaking it.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s next?</h2>
<p>I&#39;d like to do some work on the app and bring it back next year. The improvements above would certainly be added. I&#39;d like to make it possible for multiple parties to compete, so they can each set up their own &quot;room&quot; that guests can join. Then we can, for example, see which party is closest to the final results. I also like the idea of everyone who joins being assigned a competing country, to closer simulate the actual voting process and introduce a bit of additional competition.</p>
<p>The most significant piece of work would be to build up more on the admin side. This year, JSON files were uploaded to my server and I wrote a script to crunch them and calculate final scores and averages. That process should be automated, update in real-time and show the room how their votes are going.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h2>
<p>Mostly, the experience of building, releasing and using this app so quickly was hugely inspiring. Whilst side-projects have previously involved lots of build-up, long schedules and consideration of scalability, I&#39;m now inspired to work much more quickly to create prototypes that _just work_, without complex libraries and brazen attempts to look professional.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think my upcoming projects are likely to be quite so simple as to just use micro-templating, but I&#39;d love to find a templating engine which allows similarly negligible turnaround time and file size whilst being slightly more robust. I&#39;d also love to not use package managers again.</p>
<p>The feedback I got from the app was really positive, which was similarly inspiring. Next time I&#39;ve got an idea, and a few hours spare, I&#39;ll definitely try to build it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1158" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1158" class="size-full wp-image-1158" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-scores.png" alt="The scores generated from our Eurovision app" width="680" height="652" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-scores.png 680w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-scores-300x288.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/eurovision-scores-625x599.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1158" class="wp-caption-text">The total scores, votes, and averages generated on the night</p></div></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the start of 2017, I decided to completely rebuild my blog from scratch in Node.js. My old blog was hosted on WordPress but over the years I&#39;d got tired of the framework&#39;s complexity and speed issues, particularly because I didn&#39;t use the majority of the features.</p>
<p>I wanted to build something that was simple, lean, nicely designed and usable on all devices by all viewers. I was also inspired by the work Nicolás Bevacqua did on <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/two-way-synchronization-for-a-web-app-and-git">Pony Foo</a> to track his articles through Git and make it easy for anyone to suggest edits through GitHub.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to go through some of the decisions I made in redesigning <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/">gregtyler.co.uk</a> and the tools I used to do so.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-blog">Building a blog</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the technical bits. This website is written bespoke in Node, without even a application framework like Express (the notable modules I use are <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a> for Markdown parsing, <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> for code display, and <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">nunjucks</a> for templating). Not using an application framework might seem like a silly idea and, in general, it probably is. But this project was as much about learning how to build a Node application as it was about having a new blog, so I used the opportunity to learn properly about how Node handles HTTP requests and responses by handling them all myself.</p>
<p>In development I focused on a couple of major goals. One was to ensure the site is performant, which not having an application framework helps with because I can see everything happening end-to-end between a request and response. Another was to build an application that would be robust for the future. I&#39;ve got no plans to roll out the application (which I&#39;ve called &quot;Palomar&quot;) to any other websites, but designed it as if I did intend to. I also designed it to be extensible in the future so that adding new features won&#39;t require rewriting the whole application.</p>
<p>The application is hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, which is new for me. I switched from my old host because I was having performance issues, bad customer support and paying too much. So far DigitalOcean has been cheaper, faster and, whilst I haven&#39;t had to experience customer support yet, I&#39;ve been impressed by the wealth of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials">tutorials</a> on their site documenting how to install and manage all sort of software on their servers.</p>
<p>On the server, I use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> as a server and, thanks to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a>, I&#39;m using HTTPS everywhere.</p>
<p>You might wonder what database I&#39;m using, and be surprised to find that I&#39;m not. See <a href="#blogging-with-git">Blogging with Git</a> below to find out more.</p>
<h1 id="designing-a-blog">Designing a blog</h1>
<p>Anyone who visited my old blog will be familiar with the new design. The colour scheme, fonts and general layout are all very familiar, and I&#39;m continuing to use &quot;card&quot; structures on the home page.</p>
<p>There are a couple of significant changes. One is that every post has a &quot;series&quot;. These work similar to categories in other blogging platforms, except that every post only gets one, and it&#39;s used to determine where the post is stored in the Git repository. I&#39;m not sure this is the best idea, but so far it&#39;s working out quite well as a way to section off particular kinds of content (friends may not interested in my <a href="/webdev">Web development</a>, colleagues might not want to read about <a href="/christmas-2014">Christmas films</a>).</p>
<p>Another big change is the addition of &quot;linked articles&quot;. These display alongside normal articles on index and archive pages, but are actually links out to articles I&#39;ve written on other sites. This means that my blog is now the index page for <em>everything</em> I write online rather than just the things I&#39;ve written here.</p>
<p>The CSS for the site is quite simple. There&#39;s <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/main.css">one CSS file</a>, which uses no frameworks and sits at a tidy 1.9KB. I&#39;ve used the patterns of <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/">BEM</a> and <a href="http://itcss.io/">ITCSS</a>, mostly inspired by the work of <a href="https://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@shaunbent/css-at-bbc-sport-part-1-bab546184e66">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s only one JavaScript file and that&#39;s Google Analytics, which I&#39;m planning to remove for something more ethical.</p>
<h1 id="blogging-with-git">Blogging with Git</h1>
<p>By far the biggest decision in this development was moving all of the blog writing to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Git is a version control system, which means it keeps track of all of the changes ever made to a bunch of files, can give detailed history of each and restore to any point in time. It&#39;s a much more involved, powerful version of track changes.</p>
<p>The benefits of having Git support writing should be obvious, but the implementation of doing so certainly is slightly involved. I have a <a href="https://github.com/gregtyler/gregtyler-pichon">repository of all of my articles</a> which is mirrored on the blog server. The application then uses its copy of the files to render and display pages as they are requested. This means that changes can be made either on my computer, or on GitHub, and then need to be pushed onto the server before they are live.</p>
<p>As explained in the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/two-way-synchronization-for-a-web-app-and-git">article from Nicolás Bevacqua</a>, a key benefit of this is that readers can identify mistakes or improvements and fix them themselves in GitHub. It also means that, when not at home, I can write drafts and articles through GitHub&#39;s interface rather than on my computer.</p>
<p>One regret I have about the current set-up that I would like to change is that it relies on a push to the application server. In the future, I&#39;d like the server to automatically take any new updates directly from GitHub without needing a push. This would enable to handle my entire editing and publishing process through GitHub rather than needing my PC to actually put the new posts on the server.</p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s clearly more work to be done on <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/">gregtyler.co.uk</a>, but I&#39;m extremely happy with the results so far.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently read <a href="https://medium.com/assist/theres-a-dozen-ways-to-order-a-coffee-why-do-dumb-bots-only-allow-one-27230542636d">an interesting article by Shane Mac</a> about the failings of modern bots. It&#39;s a great article and well worth reading in full but to summarise, bots should accept a comment like &quot;I want to book a table at La Granja at 7 tonight&quot; and know to ask &quot;how many people?&quot;, rather than the current prescriptive back-and-forth.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about web page interactions, and where we&#39;re falling short as web developers. I think there are several themes and topics to explore here, but I&#39;d like to start by thinking about various types of interaction that are currently in place both in the web sphere, and with technology in general.</p>
<h2 id="clicking-and-pointing">Clicking and pointing</h2>
<p>The de facto standard for interacting with a web page is by clicking on things with your finger or mouse. Links were the original navigation experience of the web and were <em>fundamental</em> in shaping the network as it is today. More recently, buttons have allowed us to create rich form experiences where a user manipulates and submits data.</p>
<p>A benefit of clicking is that it opens a great many possibilities. On your first click on a laptop, there are millions of pixels available. Millions again on your second. Even on a phone, where clicking has become a physical and less-precise interaction, it&#39;s possible for developers to cram many options onto a screen.</p>
<p>However, clicking is not a very nuanced action. Right-click, long press and force touch all attempt to extend the abilities of pressing either a mouse button or a physical device. They all still have their limitations, and don&#39;t manage to quite replicate the depth of control wanted.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-interaction">Keyboard interaction</h2>
<p>Predating clicking, keyboards are the oldest form of computer interaction. However, they&#39;ve recently fallen by the wayside as touch-screen devices don&#39;t have keyboard peripherals and typically have sub-par virtual alternatives. Certainly, performing a keyboard shortcut on a phone is a real challenge with no way to naturally bring up the keyboard, and no Alt or Ctrl keys.</p>
<p>However, keyboard navigation is still <em>massive</em> for some users. For example, it&#39;s a big accessibility element for those with poor vision or motor impairments because a mouse is difficult to work with. Web accessibility teaches us to make sites completely navigable with a keyboard for these users and many (myself included) often opt to use a keyboard for speed.</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts can be extremely powerful. For users familiar with your system, it can make repetitive tasks much faster, not requiring them to move a cursor across the screen multiple times. They&#39;re omnipresent, so they can be applied by the user from any location on the page. This cuts down on scrolling, both because they don&#39;t have to go and find a button, and because they can perform operations without losing their place in the page. No scrolling back and forth to preview changes.</p>
<p>The big drawback to keyboard shortcuts is that they are absolutely not forthcoming. Whilst some commands are fairly ubiquitous (<code>Ctrl+F</code> will find something on the page, <code>Ctrl+S</code> will save what you&#39;re working on), communicating new or unusual commands is difficult. On the flip side, the ubiquitous commands can get in the way. If you want to create a shortcut for a &quot;post&quot; command, you&#39;ll find that <code>Ctrl+P</code> is taken and may be left with something that seems nonsensical.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1184" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1184" class="size-full wp-image-1184" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/office365-outlook-shortcuts.jpg" alt="The list of shortcuts in Outlook on Office 365" width="733" height="562" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/office365-outlook-shortcuts.jpg 733w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/office365-outlook-shortcuts-300x230.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/office365-outlook-shortcuts-625x479.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1184" class="wp-caption-text">A few of these main seem reasonable, but Outlook&#39;s shortcuts on Office 365 don&#39;t come naturally</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, keyboard shortcuts are hard to onboard new users with. Whilst <code>Ctrl+S</code> may seem second nature now, it&#39;s a difficult concept to explain to users. &quot;What do you mean &#39;control&#39;?&quot; &quot;Why that button?&quot; &quot;How will I remember that?&quot; Try explaining that your site needs the user to press <code>Ctrl+Shift+8</code> to create a new bookmark and I doubt they&#39;ll be thrilled.</p>
<h3 id="command-interface">Command interface</h3>
<p>An extension to keyboard input is the command interface. These days mostly reserved to developers and computer engineers, the command line used to be the default tool of all computer users. Yet only a few years ago I regularly used one in the NHS to administer patient records, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to hear they&#39;re still doing so now.</p>
<p>Where command interfaces differ from traditional keyboard input is the ability they give to create more complex instructions. Rather than <code>Ctrl+S</code>, you can ask the computer to <code>save assessments.txt --no-publish</code>.</p>
<p>Whilst this is more powerful, it exacerbates the discoverability problems of traditional shortcuts. How do you know what arguments a command accepts? What additional options can you provide? Does order matter?</p>
<p>Web sites typically don&#39;t have a command interface (I&#39;ve never seen one that isn&#39;t a novelty site), but I bring it up because in modern desktop browsers a command interface underlies all websites: the dev tools command line.</p>
<p>That command line has <em>tremendous</em> possibilities for extending website control, and they&#39;re almost consistently ignored. The most you&#39;re likely to see from websites today is a job advert suggesting that if you&#39;ve managed to press F12, you could work for them.</p>
<p>Throughout development we use the command line to debug, and we sometimes (temporarily) expose functions to it to help test things. Like the cheat codes of old, it is a hidden language allowing us to access additional features by typing <code>app.loadManyAnimals()</code>. What I would like to see more of though, is leaving these cheat codes in place and inviting power users to access them. If a user wants to pull out their data, they could run <code>app.data.toJSON()</code> to retrieve it. If they want to quickly add a note without using the UI, <code>app.insertNote(&#39;Buy milk&#39;, {reminder: &#39;16:00&#39;})</code>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1148" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1148" class="size-full wp-image-1148" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-console-getcarttotal.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the DevTools console using a public function to get a cart&#39;s total in GBP" width="625" height="132" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-console-getcarttotal.jpg 625w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-console-getcarttotal-300x63.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1148" class="wp-caption-text">You could expose functions publicly by design so that tech-savvy users could quickly access additional functionality</p></div></p>
<p>Command line interfaces aren&#39;t going to become mainstream any time soon, but I love the idea of opening up power-user features by giving them a bit more direct access. I think this would be a huge accessibility win too: I imagine keyboard-only users would rather press <code>F12</code> and type a quick command than tab around hidden buttons just to send their email.</p>
<h2 id="voice">Voice</h2>
<p>Voice interfaces have really come along recently. Last year, when Google <a href="https://madeby.google.com/phone/">announced their Pixel phone</a>, perhaps its <em>key</em> selling points was the built-in assistant that would interact with your apps and you could talk to at any time. Apple have touted Siri&#39;s convenience for years. Meanwhile, the Amazon Echo and Google Home have <em>only</em> voice input.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1137" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1137" class="size-full wp-image-1137" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/amazon-echo-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Photo of Amazon Echo device" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/amazon-echo-lifestyle.jpg 1000w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/amazon-echo-lifestyle-300x300.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/amazon-echo-lifestyle-768x768.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/amazon-echo-lifestyle-625x625.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1137" class="wp-caption-text">The Amazon Echo</p></div></p>
<p>There are two major benefits to voice interfaces, and they&#39;re clear in all the adverts: the convenience of the interface and how natural it feels. Talking with an Amazon Echo or Google Home device is like having a chat: &quot;What&#39;s the weather today?&quot; &quot;How about tomorrow?&quot; &quot;And this weekend?&quot; When a topic pops into your head you can just ask it there and then.</p>
<p>The downside to voice is that when it goes wrong, it&#39;s extremely frustrating. It can feel insulting, as if you weren&#39;t clear enough, or your accent is too thick. And it can be very hard to correct, particularly on these voice-only devices: there&#39;s no text box to type in what you really mean, or mouse to close the application that has opened.</p>
<p>Voice interfaces aren&#39;t easy to use in public. In part because it can be quite embarrassing (no-one wants to hear an office colleague try and fail to order pizza with their voice), and also because background noise can get in the way. I&#39;m yet to see a parody of someone trying to use Siri at a gig to take a photo, but I&#39;m sure it exists.</p>
<p>Finally, voice commands have a weird relationship with discoverability. There aren&#39;t really instructions on how to use Alexa and pals, or what questions to ask them. But that&#39;s because it <em>should</em> follow your natural expectations, and it&#39;s prepared to publicly admit defeat (whereas failed keyboard shortcuts just don&#39;t do anything). In this way, voice interfaces are quite fascinating: an average user may never find certain parts of a tool&#39;s vocabulary, or have any way to find them, but still feel quite complacent that they know it well.</p>
<h2 id="physical-inputs">Physical inputs</h2>
<p>Lastly, I want to talk briefly about physical inputs. Physical inputs are, to my mind, those which connect the real world around you with the websites you are accessing. For example cameras, light sensitivity meters and accelerometers. I think physical controllers like those in VR fall into this category to, but I have so little experience with them that that&#39;s the only mention they&#39;ll get.</p>
<p>In the web, physical inputs are uncommon. Cameras and microphones are probably the most used, but that&#39;s typically for uses explicitly based around them: e.g. recordings and video calls. Beyond that, physical inputs are sometimes used in games in interesting ways, but I want us to explore their use in web applications.</p>
<p>The first usage of physical inputs that came to my mind was this: when typing a note or message you can shake your phone to quickly clear what you&#39;ve written and start again. I think that would be a really helpful metaphor across multiple apps. Whether you&#39;re tweeting, emailing, writing a note, shaking would clear it.</p>
<p>The difficulty though, is how do we get to that common metaphor? Like a keyboard shortcut, we need to teach users it&#39;s there. But even more complexly, we need to get them to think differently about how they interact with their device.</p>
<p>I think this is an exciting area to explore. The idea of using physical actions and interactions to create a complex interface sounds quite exciting, and the promise of tools like Shazam and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Goggles">Google Goggles</a> demonstrates the power of using these tools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Clicking and pointing is still the de facto of user interfaces on the web, and I don&#39;t see that changing any time soon. But I&#39;m really excited about the possibilities of enabling future interaction through the dev tools command line and physical input. I also can&#39;t wait to see how voice control makes it way to web interfaces.</p>
<p>In the future, I&#39;ll be writing about some practical applications of new interface methods and also looking further at the process flow and conversational interactions that Shane talks about in his article.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few years (<a href="/personal/2015-year-in-review">2015</a>, <a href="/personal/2014-year-in-review">2014</a>, <a href="/personal/2013-year-in-review">2013</a>), I finished each December with a &quot;Year in Review&quot;: an categorised list of the things I&#39;ve done in the year, what I&#39;ve enjoyed, and what I&#39;ve seen. 2015 was, I concluded, &quot;completely rad&quot;. 2014 was &quot;a perfectly pleasant year&quot;. 2013, most introspectively, was &quot;a year of development&quot;. This year I&#39;ve run out of platitudes.</p>
<p>So I want to do this year&#39;s post a bit differently. I&#39;m going to focus on the good things first. Then I&#39;ll take a look at some of the bad world events. Finally I&#39;ll take a look at my resolutions from last year, and set some new goals for 2017. I&#39;ll split up each section so you can read the bits that interest you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2016-the-good-parts">2016: The good parts</h2>
<p>Work was very positive and kind of unusual. I&#39;m continuing to work at the University, with the exciting new job title of &quot;Analyst/Developer&quot;. With that title has come some workload change, and I&#39;ve spent much longer trying to figure out data strategy rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>More specifically, I&#39;ve spent most of the year working on our <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/student-systems/support-guidance/admin-support-staff/student-admin-colleges-schools/assessment-and-progression">Assessment and Progression tools</a> project. This sprawling multi-year project has easily enough work to keep five of us busy full-time, and plenty more besides. Its duration and scope have given us a great opportunity to experiment with project management too, which has been an inimitable learning experience.</p>
<p>Away from my day-to-day work, other jobs and side projects have been going well. I&#39;m still hosting at the Dagda Quiz, with a growing crowd, and still doing little projects both for extra pocket money and for fun. Rebuilding <a href="/">this very website</a> in Node was fascinating, and I need to blog about it. More widely, I&#39;ve loved experimenting more with JavaScript both server- and client-side. I&#39;ve enjoyed working with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and, most recently, <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/12826308_1657289891202468_1593059020_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTIwMDIyNzI3NDU5OTQ3MjkyNw%3D%3D.2" alt="Venice skyline" /><br />
2016 was a great year for travel. I finally visited the magical city of Venice, and was strangely fortunate to witness it flood. As well as beautiful architecture and incredible views, Venice offered up wonderful food and drink and provided an excellent destination for a long weekend.</p>
<p>I went to the USA for the first time, visiting Utah, Arizona and Las Vegas. I feel really lucky to have managed to see so many different experiences in that one trip: we toured Mormon temples, visited national parks, saw cave paintings, drove through the Wild West and lost some money in the world&#39;s best known casinos. It&#39;s a trip I&#39;ll never forget.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13696990_1095775467183444_960294933_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMxMDE5OTcwMjEwMDYzMTg3OA%3D%3D.2" alt="Copenhagen" /><br />
In August, I went with a friend on a long weekend to Denmark and Sweden, primarily to watch one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii">Avicii&#39;s</a> last live shows. The show was great, and I was absolutely taken with what I saw of Scandinavia too. Copenhagen particularly is a beautiful city.</p>
<p>In the summer, I took part in the regular family pilgrimage to Shetland. Shetland is a lovely place, and a wonderful location to get away from it all. I also visited London, Chelmsford, Whitby, Arran, Peebles, Bristol, Oxford, The Cairngorms, Yorkshire, York (twice) and Sheffield to continue my goals of visiting more of my own country.</p>
<p>This was also the year that I started using Instagram, which might seem like an odd thing to highlight in this post, but it really tied in well to my travelling. I started using it because I wanted to take better photographs, and to document the things that I&#39;ve been doing over the year. Looking back now, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsgregtyler/">my account</a> has a wonderful collection of pictures from around the UK and the world and I&#39;m thrilled to be able to reminisce with them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2016-the-bad-parts">2016: The bad parts</h2>
<p>Despite the travelling, and development at work, 2016 is not a year I can look back at fondly. It&#39;s a year in which my European identity <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results">was taken away from me</a>; in which an elected official was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36550304">murdered for her political views</a>; in which hate crimes rose in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37640982">UK</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38149406">US</a>; in which newspapers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/lets-party-like-its-1933-inside-the-disturbing-alt-right-world-of-richard-spencer/2016/11/22/cf81dc74-aff7-11e6-840f-e3ebab6bcdd3_story.html">profiled Nazis</a> and normalised their viewpoints; in which the President elect of the United States used Twitter to attempt to shame and damage <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/donald-trump-targets-boeing-shares-fall-twitter-air-force-one-planes-dennis-muilenburg-a7458946.html">business</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-vanity-fair-review_us_58532656e4b0b3ddfd8bf408">adverseries</a> having run a campaign of bullying, lying and misogyny on an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>2016 seemed like the culmination of a lot of things that have been brewing for years. EU resentment, worry for financial security in an increasing world population, and traditional racism together found a cause to get behind in Brexit. Similar intersectionality in the US gave way to Trump&#39;s election as anti-establishment movements, disenfranchised voters and sexists all found an individual campaign to get behind. And as we look on now, it&#39;s hard not to blur the lines between those groups. To all of our detriment.</p>
<p>Looking back over the year&#39;s events–particularly Brexit, the US election and Russian activities–it&#39;s been hard to put together a singular identification of quite what&#39;s going wrong. The media are involved, as is the rise of fascism in parts of America and Europe, and our modern news portals like Facebook and Twitter have a hand too. But there doesn&#39;t seem to be a unifying thing and I find that a bit terrifying.</p>
<p>To me, a huge problem has been people voting selfishly. In all recent political engagements, on both sides, voters regularly identify (both in public quotes and personal conversations) as voting for the option that provides them with the most financial or influential gain. Trump voters are able to look over his misgivings and mistakes because they believe that, as a businessman, he will help them earn and hold onto their money. Brexit voters almost without exception quoted EU membership costs (paid from taxes) as a reason for their support.</p>
<p>There is, of course, an argument that Trump <em>won&#39;t</em> help others get rich and that leaving the EU will cost <em>more</em> than membership fees. But my concern is with the number of people voting purely for themselves and not thinking of what&#39;s best for everyone else. In simplest terms, if everyone voted for themselves and the majority always won then we would not have seen an end to slavery, there would be no LGBT rights and UK women would just about be clinging on to suffrage.</p>
<p>On a more realistic level, it&#39;s phrases like &quot;why should I pay for others to use the NHS when I don&#39;t need it myself?&quot; that worry me. Recently I saw a discussion about whether voters should have a say on how much of their tax is spent on foreign aid. Whilst others seem to find <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> being funded by their TV license the greatest affront of the year.</p>
<p>This constant &quot;what&#39;s in it for me?&quot; attitude, and lack of sight beyond one&#39;s own bubble, are at risk of dismantling the work of socialism that has taken so long to achieve. And that damage falls only onto the bottom of society, as the alternative is a world designed for those with money to continue getting it and leave the rest behind.</p>
<p>These programmes–the NHS, the welfare state, social security, equal rights, the EU–took years to form and could be undone in an instant. If we don&#39;t support them, they will be lost. Not (just) by politicians who seek to profit from their demise, but from our own citizens who don&#39;t see the benefit of the programme, don&#39;t emphasise with its beneficiaries, and don&#39;t see themselves in a role of supporting others.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why 2016 has sucked so much for me: we are marching ever further down a dangerous path in which we lose some of our country&#39;s best work.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="resolutions-and-looking-forward">Resolutions and looking forward</h2>
<p>Last year, for the first time in many years, I wrote some <a href="/personal/resolutions-for-2016">resolutions for myself</a>. Let&#39;s see how I got on.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write 20 blog posts or articles of at least 1000 words.</strong> I wrote 16 articles last year across three different blogs, and I&#39;m pretty happy with that. I think, in retrospect, the target number was too high.</li>
<li><strong>Watch 10 silent films.</strong> I didn&#39;t do this, so I&#39;m pushing it forward to 2017.</li>
<li><strong>Record at least one podcast episode.</strong> Nor this. Also for 2017.</li>
<li><strong>Play 24 hours of badminton.</strong> Whilst I didn&#39;t achieve this, I <em>did</em> join a gym and start going regularly. Considering the reason for wanting to play badminton was for fitness, I think I can consider this achieved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite considering some resolutions achieved when I didn&#39;t actually meet the success criteria, I want to continue this year to set specific measurable targets for 2017. It gives me something to aim for, to track progress with, and to look back at.</p>
<h3 id="1-write-12-blog-posts-or-articles-of-at-least-1000-words">1. Write 12 blog posts or articles of at least 1000 words</h3>
<p>It&#39;s back! 12 articles this year because it&#39;s more attainable, and works out at one-per-month.</p>
<p><a href="/ssl-read-errno-10054/">SSL 10054</a> is still my most popular article by far. And user retention has gone up since switching from WordPress to custom Node.js, even though features like &quot;recommended articles&quot; and search are now missing.</p>
<h3 id="2-record-at-least-one-podcast-episode">2. Record at least one podcast episode</h3>
<p>Also back. In the past year, I&#39;ve sketched out some more ideas of what I want to do and been fascinated that the idea I have hasn&#39;t been done by someone else yet. I want to get this one done early.</p>
<h3 id="3-release-five-games">3. Release five games</h3>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, I like making games and game design. I really enjoy the challenge of making something fun and balanced, if only for five minutes. Secondly, making browser-based games is a great opportunity to try new libraries and frameworks. It&#39;s helped me experiment with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte</a>, and I hope this year to use this to play with <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> and maybe <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="4-watch-10-silent-movies">4. Watch 10 silent movies</h3>
<p>I&#39;m not sure this is important in and of itself, but I want to do it because I failed to last year and I don&#39;t like losing. Even to myself.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also want to make a few non-measurable general goals for 2017. These are things I don&#39;t really have a way of tracking, that I just want to try work into my general attitude for the year.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify as more than a web developer.</strong> I don&#39;t like introducing myself when meeting people as &quot;a university web developer&quot;. I want to do much more than that. So, by the end of the year, I want to be able to rattle off a few things I do rather than just one.</li>
<li><strong>Take better photographs.</strong> Photos have meant a lot to me this year, and will continue to do so when I look back at them. I want to ensure they are of the highest quality.</li>
<li><strong>Educate more.</strong> I know a lot about technology and security that I could pass on to family and friends. I want to help them have a safe, secure and happy time on the web. I also want to talk more about my political views rather than descending into baseless arguments.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Marrying traditional Christmas characters with a police procedural, the body of someone in a Santa Claus costume falls from the sky. Castle and the team investigate.</em></p>
<p>Some background on the show: <em>Castle</em> is part of the growing number of police procedurals in which a police crew have some sort of assistant with no investigative experience, but who uses their other skills to solve crimes (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mentalist">The Mentalist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)">Numbers</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)">Monk</a>). In the case of _Castle_, our consultant (the eponymous Richard Castle) is a crime author who reverse-engineers stories to make sense of the clues.</p>
<p><em>Castle&#39;s</em> real strength is its ability to merge fantasy elements into serious crime plots. There have been episodes about zombie outbreaks, vampires hunting the streets, spaceships, westerns, and just about every other genre you can think of. &quot;Secret Santa&quot;, our chosen episode today, starts with the body of a large, white-haired man dressed as Santa falling into the middle of Central Park.</p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>![Richard Castle surrounded by Christmas decorations](/castle-secret-santa-decorations.jpg &quot;:right &quot;Decorations? Yeah, we got decorations.&quot;&quot;)</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>The primary plot of this &#8211; the investigation into the mysterious Santa body &#8211; has some wonderful Christmas moments. The victim turns out to have committed his life to portraying Santa and bringing joy to those around him, helping out his neighbours and friends.</p>
<p>As part of the trail, there&#39;s a trip to Santa School, where we get to see a room full of Santas-in-waiting as they pratice their ho-ho-hos and belly laughs.</p>
<p>The secondary story also elicits much festive spirit, with Castle being a huge fan of the season and trying to encourage his family and friends to enjoy spending time together and celebrating their closeness. His decorations are lavish, his childlike-joy palpable, and it&#39;s very hard to not be inspired by that.</p>
<div id="attachment_1147" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1147" class="size-full wp-image-1147" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-school.jpg" alt="A room full of Santas being trained to laugh" width="1025" height="576" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-school.jpg 1025w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-school-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-school-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-school-625x351.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1147" class="wp-caption-text">Santa School!</p></div>
<p>Castle&#39;s detective partner Beckett is not so keen on Christmas. Effectively playing the role of Scrooge, she knocks back down all hints that the body might be that of <em>actual</em> Santa, and rebuffs Castle&#39;s offers of spending Christmas Eve with his family. But all is not lost as the Christmas Carol parallels go full circle and Beckett eventually decides to skip work and spend Christmas with her friends rather than behind a desk.</p>
<p>The spirit is lost though once they identify their Santa-a-like and start the real detective work. Suddenly we fall into the well of clues, leads, witness interviews and very un-Christmassy like behaviour. I don&#39;t think it can be helped, but it does take the edge of the relaxed festive feel.</p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>&quot;Secret Santa&quot; plays a strong festive music game. Reminiscent of <em>Die Hard_, a plethora of traditional carols and songs are subtly woven into the soundtrack. I caught _Let It Snow_, _I Saw Three Ships_, _Deck the Halls_, _Good King Wenceslas</em> and <em>The Holly and the Ivy</em> all in the background of the show.</p>
<p>None of the music is particularly in your face though, which is why I compare it to <em>Die Hard</em>. It helps add to the atmosphere of it being Christmas without ramming it down your throat, which I&#39;ve always thought particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<div id="attachment_1146" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1146" class="size-full wp-image-1146" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-gun.jpg" alt="Santa at gunpoint" width="1025" height="576" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-gun.jpg 1025w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-gun-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-gun-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/castle-secret-santa-gun-625x351.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1146" class="wp-caption-text">Seeing a cop pull a gun on Santa doesn&#39;t feel like the most family-appropriate Christmas television.</p></div>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>I think <em>Castle</em> is a great show through-and-through. It&#39;s got serious crime plots, but a wonderful childlike atmosphere through its title character and an uninhibited ability to explore wild plot devices. I reckon that makes it suitable for a really wide audience from teenagers to pensioners.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s particularly family friendly. I mean, it&#39;s about serious crimes. Murders and the like. And this episode is no exception.</p>
<p>Further, &quot;Secret Santa&quot; is <em>very</em> clear that Father Christmas isn&#39;t real, and that attitude always knocks some points off in this category.</p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p><em>Castle</em> has a solid core cast, fronted by Nathan Fillion, and they all get proper screen time in &quot;Secret Santa&quot;. But with no special guests, there&#39;s nothing special about the cast in this episode. Disappointing for a show that&#39;s featured an impressive field of guest stars over its eight seasons.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Whilst full of Christmas joy on a personal level, &quot;Secret Santa&quot; doesn&#39;t quite put in enough effort to make this a true Christmas special. It&#39;s got some of the heart, but it wouldn&#39;t have you gathering the family around the television. A lot of thought has been made to make this fit into the series, so you wouldn&#39;t feel out of place binge-watching it in August. That&#39;s fine, and quite skilled, but it doesn&#39;t give it the special festive flavour that I want to see.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Six pantomime favourites, Father Christmas and Roy Wood gather round to answer questions. Some on a Christmassy bent, others not so much.</em></p>
<p>You might be surprised to hear that Pointless has been on television since 2009, with Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman steering the helm for all that time. Seven years later, it appears in Armstrong&#39;s &quot;best known as&quot; lede <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Armstrong">on Wikipedia</a>. In that time they&#39;ve had several Christmas specials, and the 2013 one stands out to me.</p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<div id="attachment_1189" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1189" class="size-full wp-image-1189" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-contestants.jpg" alt="The contestants" width="1025" height="398" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-contestants.jpg 1025w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-contestants-300x116.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-contestants-768x298.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-contestants-625x243.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1189" class="wp-caption-text">The contestants</p></div>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>The 2013 line-up includes the pairings of: Brookside alums and pantomime faves Linda Lusari and Sam Kane; Paul and Barry Chuckle; Keith Harris and Orville; and Roy Wood and Santa.</p>
<p>Keith and Orville are a strange combination, seeing as their both the same person. You can&#39;t help but feel that that would be a bit of a handicap for Britain&#39;s most famous ventriloquist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you may not recognise Wood by name, but he&#39;s the front-man of Wizzard and responsible for writing their big Christmas hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoxQ4Ul_DME">I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday</a>. It was recognised at the time that most of Wizzard&#39;s creative input came from Wood, and perhaps that lone-wolf mentality explains his pairing with a Santa impersonator rather than a colleague or contempoary.</p>
<p>Santa turns out to be a bit of a pain in the arse. He&#39;s a bit too keen to be the centre of attention, and stumbles a bit with ad libbing. But he does have <a href="http://celebritysantaclaus.co.uk/">his own website</a> which it&#39;s worth taking a diversion to investigate. He has a <a href="http://celebritysantaclaus.co.uk/santa-wardrobe/">wide wardrobe of outfits</a> and confusingly serves &quot;London, Manchester, Birmingham, [&#8230;], UK, GB&quot;. A bit of rogue SEO perhaps.</p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>Round 1 provides some musical fun, asking teams to identify performers on Band Aid 20. Admittedly this isn&#39;t actually Christmas music, but you can&#39;t help but get the song in your head a bit.</p>
<div id="attachment_1139" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1139" class="size-full wp-image-1139" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/band-aid-20.jpg" alt="Members of Band Aid 20" width="600" height="306" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/band-aid-20.jpg 600w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/band-aid-20-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1139" class="wp-caption-text">How many can you name?</p></div>
<p>There&#39;s also a Christmas song question in the head-to-head, where contestants need to unscramble the names of song titles. Other than &quot;Blob By Mr&quot;, these are actually quite hard for a celebrity episode.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1190" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-jumble.jpg" alt="&quot;Scrambled up song names: Starlit Chasms, Onto Freakier Flyway, A Magical Carp Enslavement, Blob By Mr, Ace Myrrh Serenity Movers&quot;" width="1025" height="576" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-jumble.jpg 1025w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-jumble-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-jumble-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-jumble-625x351.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /></p>
<p>But where the Christmas music juices really start flowing is after the quiz has concluded and it&#39;s revealed that &quot;Roy Wood and his band&quot; will be performing &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot; live in the studio. This goes down extremely well with contestants and audience alike who dutifully clap and sing along. And it&#39;s really nice actually. It feels very fun, positive, and seasonal.</p>
<p>Then you suddenly remember that this must be filmed in <em>at least</em> September, and it all feels slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>I already mentioned two of the Christmas spirited rounds. Round two also had a vague Christmas flavour, asking teams to name countries ending in &quot;-an&quot; (the connection being that Santa has to visit all the countries of the world). Only 15 answers were available, none of them pointless, and it was interesting to see what the most obscure were.</p>
<p>Amusingly, this wasn&#39;t a good round for Santa, who played for time a lot and complained that they &quot;kept changing their names&quot;. I suppose he has been around a good long time.</p>
<div id="attachment_1191" style="width: 934px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1191" class="size-full wp-image-1191" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-sleighbells.jpg" alt="Richard Osman holding some sleigh bells" width="924" height="656" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-sleighbells.jpg 924w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-sleighbells-300x213.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-sleighbells-768x545.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pointless-christmas-sleighbells-625x444.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1191" class="wp-caption-text">Richard Osman dons his Christmas jumper and shakes his bells</p></div>
<p>The set was decorated, Christmas jumpers were donned, and sleigh bells were available to the hosts. Add the live music, and you&#39;ve got quite the Christmas special. But questions on Scooby Doo and football did take some of the Christmas shine off, and remind you that you&#39;re watching a game show.</p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Aside from a hint by Santa that he might not be exactly what he&#39;s cracked up to be, there is nothing at here to offend anyone of any age. And being a celebrity special, the questions are all conveniently much more accessible. The jokes are lighthearted, with Armstrong and Osman their typical, charming selves.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>A great Christmas show! Full of classic tropes and festive fun.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to watch the Pointless 2013 special, you can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0iSMtpCh0">on YouTube</a>.</p>

<div id="attachment_1183" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1183" class="size-full wp-image-1183" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ofah-christmas-crackers.jpg" alt="Scene from Christmas Crackers of Del Boy carving turkey for himself, Rodney and Grandad" width="382" height="280" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ofah-christmas-crackers.jpg 382w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ofah-christmas-crackers-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1183" class="wp-caption-text">Del Boy carving the Christmas roast</p></div>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p><em>Only Fools and Horses</em> was my first pick for a Christmas TV special because of how many Christmas specials they did. Between 1991 and 2003, the show put out nothing <em>but</em> Christmas specials. &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Crackers_(Only_Fools_and_Horses)">Christmas Crackers</a>&quot; was their first, and the most Christmassy special I could find.</p>
<p>&quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; is a bit of a weird episode of television. The first half of it follows Del Boy and Rodney&#39;s Christmas dinner, thanklessly prepared by Grandad. After that (expectedly) goes rather badly, and Grandad decides to head off to the Old Folk&#39;s Christmas Party, the brothers decide to head out themselves.</p>
<p>The first half is full of class Christmassy tropes. They have a big Christmas spread with all the trimmings (though not all in the right place). The flat is decorated with tree and tinsel. Everyone&#39;s wearing those paper crowns. They even catch The Sound of Music on the television.</p>
<p>Del Boy also makes a really nice speech about how important it is to spend Christmas with their Grandad, because a lot of people aren&#39;t as lucky to have family around. It&#39;s feels sweet and honest: a true testament to the shared joy so many have at this time of the year.</p>
<p>The speech would be a good ending to the episode, but it actually introduces the turn: Grandad doesn&#39;t want their company and goes out himself, so the brothers figure they should head to the club too. After that point, you&#39;d be forgiven for not knowing what time of the year it&#39;s set at.</p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>David Jason is wonderful, a regular national treasure. Even Del Boy at this point feels like a real person, and it brought a little joy to my heart to be reminded of his wonderful, positive enthusiasm and ambition.</p>
<p>But I added this category to celebrate productions taking that extra effort to break from the norm and bring some exciting cameos for your Christmas episode, which <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> sadly didn&#39;t do.</p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>I loved <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> as a kid, and watching it again now is a real pleasure. It&#39;s a funny and clever show that mixes witty dialogue and physical comedy, whilst still feeling quite real. I&#39;d say it&#39;s great for all ages.</p>
<p>However, I think there&#39;s a real nostalgia influence here. There are lots of references to things of the era, and reminders of Christmas dinners very much of the 80s and 90s: not least a still fresh wave of excitement around festive television. I don&#39;t know how well that would play with viewers born after, say, 1998. Since that includes _all children_, I think a few &quot;family fun&quot; points have to be docked.</p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>There is not a single Christmas song, but it does have some great 80s music.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Let&#39;s be honest, &quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; is definitely not the best <em>Only Fools and Horses</em> episode. It&#39;s probably not even the best Christmas special (looking at you, _<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93bAdEf0pzc">Hereos and Villains</a>_). But it&#39;s entertaining, pleasant, and really captures the vibe of Christmas in Britain before the turn of the millenium.</p>
<p>I think this is a solid start to my Christmas TV specials this year. It brings a bit of festive mirth, some deep-set nostalgia and a couple of reminders of what makes this time of year so important to people around the world. I expect much more of that on all fronts in the coming weeks.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been in the business of picking libraries. Barcodes, PDFs and automated testing suites have been particularly in my sights recently, but it&#39;s a topic that comes up regularly. With that in mind, I thought I&#39;d provide a guide of things I look out for when picking what to use. A buying guide for software libraries, if you will.   </p>
<p>Picking the best library is an important decision. Moreover, selecting poorly has the potential to really hinder your project in the future. Unfortunately, there are a lot of complex considerations to factor in to your decision. I think all of the ones I list here are important, but the weight put on each will differ between projects, people and subject matter. I&#39;d be really interested to hear how important you think each of them is, as well as anything else you take into consideration.   </p>
<p>I should note that, due to personal experience, this mainly comes from the point-of-view of picking JavaScript libraries, but I believe it&#39;s completely transferable to other languages too.   </p>
<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>I doubt you&#39;ll be surprised to see this high up in the list. If you&#39;re picking a barcode library and it doesn&#39;t produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39">Code 39</a> then it&#39;s immediately out. Of course, not all functionality is as clearly nuanced as this so, if you can, it helps to identify up-front exactly what you need it to be able to do. I also try and think to the future, and what functionality we might need for the next iteration, or if we get funding to expand what we do with it.   </p>
<p>When you get into shortlisting territory, functionality is something I find it&#39;s worth experimenting with yourself. Creating a small mock-up of what you&#39;re going to do with it can highlight gaps which might not be clear from the documentation but could stop you dead in your tracks.   </p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>On the web we often think of APIs in terms of how services interact with each other, often through RESTful or GraphQL interfaces. In this context though, I&#39;m thinking more locally of how your existing codebase interacts with the library that you&#39;re looking to use. If you&#39;re using an app which is implemented solely with HTML (examples in Lea Verou&#39;s <a href="http://markapp.io/">MarkApp</a>), this decision is likely to be quite straightforward.   </p>
<p>However, if your code is going to make calls to or reference the library then you need to ensure that they can interoperate in a way befitting your codebase, the library, and your sanity as a code author. I think a good thing to look out for is whether the design of the API matches its functionality. I expect a simple barcode library to have one function: <code>drawBarcode</code>. A more complex API may imply a tool that isn&#39;t well thought out, or is only a half-baked fork of another library.   </p>
<p>It&#39;s probably important to note that I don&#39;t think that a bad API means that a library is bad, but I&#39;ve found it can be a good indicator of problems elsewhere. Plus, it&#39;s one of the few bits of the library you as a developer will see, so picking something you&#39;ll hate working with needs to facilitate some serious payoff.   </p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>If you can, I completely advise avoiding dependencies. I still work on projects which use a certain library purely because it&#39;s a dependency for something critical. You don&#39;t want to be adding jQuery to every page just because you wanted to add a filter to tables. Whilst you might use jQuery every day now, it&#39;s nice to know that you could drop it and wouldn&#39;t have to also find a new table filterer.   </p>
<p>Sometimes dependencies may be unavoidable. For example, it used to be hard to find a good multiselect or tablesorter plugin that didn&#39;t use jQuery, Mootools or Prototype. In that case, it&#39;s best to opt for something you already use. You certainly don&#39;t want to have to keep using both jQuery <em>and</em> Prototype just because of legacy plugins you&#39;re still supporting. But these scenarios are far less common now.   </p>
<p>(No hate for jQuery, it&#39;s just a good example. I still use it on loads of projects.)   </p>
<h2 id="file-size">File size</h2>
<p>Web pages are getting <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">ridiculously big</a>, and a massive contributor is unnecessarily large JavaScript libraries. Users hate slow websites, and slow websites very often are caused by bloated libraries. So don&#39;t use them.   </p>
<p>Obviously, some libraries will be bigger than others. The difficult question is weighing size against functionality. In it&#39;s most basic form, if two libraries give you the exact same functionality and one is even 3 bytes bigger, choose the small one. With more nuanced decision making, consider what your budget is, what you&#39;re loading already, and what you can afford.   </p>
<p>If there&#39;s nothing that will fit into your page load budget, consider whether you can build it yourself. It may be more for you to support, but if it helps your users get snappy load time and encourages them to keep using your site, then the cost of that support is easily worth it.   </p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>Support is always a <em>huge</em> point of consideration for me. When I&#39;m browsing libraries, I love being able to browse their issues on GitHub (or hosting platform of choice). Red flags for me include:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of open issues (support not being actively provided)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No issues at all, or only issues opened by the developer (no-one else is using this)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Issues closed without resolution</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Issues which have been open a long time (typically hints that they may be fixing the easy, small things)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas things I like to see include: active discussion involving the developers, newbie questions answered probably (instead of being told to Read the Manual), pull requests being accepted from others with sensible reviews.   </p>
<p>As with anything in this list, there are of course exceptions and you should be careful not to draw the wrong conclusion. Font Awesome has <a href="https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues">3,718</a> unresolved issues at time of writing, but only 38 are bugs. If you care about your library choices, be sure to look deeper than just the big number at the top.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a great experience recently when I was trying out the <a href="http://webdriver.io/">WebdriverIO library</a>. I found <a href="https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/1354">a bug</a> with the library and reported it, tried and failed to fix it myself. A developer replied within 24 hours with a fix. That support was fantastic and it allowed me to freely get on with my job. I&#39;ve been using WebdriverIO ever since, and can confidently state that support as one of the reasons why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also worth looking at: forum posts, Stack Overflow questions (and their answers), blog articles. You may well need support, and it&#39;s good to know it&#39;s going to be there.   </p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>For even the most basic of libraries, documentation is essential for your new library. Without it, you won&#39;t be able to start. It&#39;s also your first point of support and perhaps your only opportunity to get an answer without having to wait for someone to reply. The best libraries have such good documentation that you don&#39;t ever need to ask for help. If you think about it, I&#39;m sure you can pick out some choice libraries that you&#39;ve never had to look further than the documentation to use. Perhaps not as many as you&#39;d like though.   </p>
<p>If you&#39;ve got time, looking through a history of the documentation can be a very good indicator of how the developers treat it. What looks like great documentation at first might not have been updated in two years of new versions. If documentation has only recently been introduced, this could mean it&#39;s a new important priority, or that it&#39;s not going to be kept up-to-date past this point.   </p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>Is the library owned by a company, an individual or an organisation? All of them have pros and cons.   </p>
<p>I would say that something like the jQuery Foundation or Mozilla is the most preferable, because their strategy is to support developers like us to make great things.   </p>
<p>If a company owns the library, consider what their edge is. Many companies aren&#39;t going to support a library without a determined way to make money out of it. This might be by selling support, <a href="http://themes.getbootstrap.com/">by selling premium features</a>, by <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">using it as a vehicle to promote other products</a>. Maybe they plan to hold future versions hostage. In many cases though, it&#39;s just to raise their company profile by getting their name out there. But you&#39;ve still got to be aware that the rug could be <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/">pulled from under your feet</a> if their business case stops adding up.   </p>
<p>If an individual owns it, then what&#39;s their motivation to keep supporting it? What plans do they have when they stop? Again, consider what would happen if you were to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">lose it overnight</a>.   </p>
<h2 id="ability-to-edit">Ability to edit</h2>
<p>I think it&#39;s good to know if the library accepts pull requests. If you find bugs you want to fix or new functionality to add, you want to be able to do it at the source. The alternative is forking, which means you&#39;ll miss updates and have to support yourself. If you choose to do that, you&#39;ll be supporting legacy software in your project and might as well write your whole own library.   </p>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t have much to say on price because, in this amazing world of open source, I haven&#39;t paid for a library in years. I would suggest that you have to re-evaluate almost everything in this list, weighing up the difference in price between each option against the functionality, support, documentation etc. that you&#39;ll gain.   </p>
<p>Paying can be worthwhile. <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> looks amazing, and I understand it&#39;s well worth the price tag if charts are a fundamental part of your application. If something is important enough to justify the price tag, don&#39;t just turn it down because you&#39;re cheap. Though equally, don&#39;t spend money on something with great flashy demos without evaluating it first (I&#39;ve fallen foul of this many times in life).   </p>
<hr>
<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve picked some libraries that have turned out great. Tools that I&#39;ve used for years since. But I&#39;ve also picked some duds, even when I&#39;ve been careful. In the real world, you can&#39;t account for everything and sometimes you&#39;ll get caught out. Yet you can mitigate that damage by choosing wisely and being aware of what you&#39;ve got. Minimising dependencies, understanding the reality of support and ownership, and knowing how you&#39;ll use the library are all extremely valuable bits of information.</p>

      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2016 19:56:10 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently when using the <code>saveScreenshot</code> function of WebdriverIO, I came across the following Node error:   </p>
<pre><code>ENOENT: no such file or directory, open &#39;{filepath}&#39;</code></pre>
<p>There are a lot of reasons this error could occur, all of which I looked at when trying to solve the problem. Because they are widely spread across the internet, and I couldn&#39;t find anyone addressing the problem I actually had, I thought I would enumerate them here.   </p>
<p>I&#39;ve also given some <a href="https://github.com/gregtyler/enoent">example code</a> for you to look at and play with. Reproducing the errors may help you figure out what causes them.   </p>
<h2 id="1-you-re-trying-to-read-a-file-that-doesn-t-exist">1. You&#39;re trying to read a file that doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
<p>As the error message suggests, the file you&#39;re trying to read isn&#39;t there.   </p>
<p><strong>To fix:</strong> Use the first parameter of the (e.g. <code>readFile</code>) function to catch the error. Perhaps use <code>fs.stat</code> or <code>fs.access</code> to check for access first.   </p>
<h2 id="2-you-re-trying-to-create-a-file-in-a-directory-that-doesn-t-exist">2. You&#39;re trying to create a file in a <em>directory</em> that doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
<p>Node won&#39;t create your intermediary directories. So if you try to create a file <code>logs/pushout.log</code> and <code>logs</code> directory doesn&#39;t exist, you&#39;ll see this error.   </p>
<p><strong>To fix:</strong> Create the <code>logs</code> directory first with <code>fs.mkdir</code>.   </p>
<h2 id="3-you-re-using-a-relative-path-incorrectly">3. You&#39;re using a relative path incorrectly</h2>
<p>This often is related to Issue 2, but without the developer&#39;s knowledge. Paths specified in <code>fs</code> functions are relative to the _currently executing script location_, not the file where the code is called from. So if <code>index.js</code> calls <code>processes/makeLogFile.js</code>, then the path used is relative to <code>index.js</code>.   </p>
<p><strong>To fix:</strong> Either use <code>__dirname</code> to get the path that the code is being written in, and add to that, or add subdirectories as necessary.   </p>
<h2 id="4-you-re-trying-to-create-a-file-that-can-t-exist">4. You&#39;re trying to create a file that <em>can&#39;t</em> exist</h2>
<p>This was my problem. I had the following, fairly self-explanatory code:   </p>
<pre><code>driver.saveScreenshot(&#39;./screens/error-&#39;   (new Date()).toISOString()   &#39;.png&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>This was supposed to create a unique screenshot in the <code>screens</code> directory but I got the ENOENT error instead.   </p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t account for is that <code>toISOString()</code> creates a time format with colons in it, and Windows will not allow colons in file names. So the error wasn&#39;t really saying that the file <em>doesn&#39;t</em> exist, but that it simply <em>couldn&#39;t</em>.   </p>
<p><strong>To fix:</strong> My fix was just using <code>replace(/:/g, &#39;-&#39;)</code> to turn all the colons into hyphens. But, generally, fix this by making sure there are no disallowed characters in the file name.   </p>
<hr>
<p>I hope these explanations help you. If you&#39;ve got any questions, corrections or additions, please <a href="https://github.com/gregtyler/enoent/issues">open an issue</a> on the GitHub repository containing the example code.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels a bit silly writing articles about handling very specific bugs, but <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/ssl-read-errno-10054/">a similar article I wrote previously</a> is consistently one of my most-viewed articles and appears high in Google search results. So, assuming that&#39;s because it&#39;s useful, I&#39;ll do so again.   </p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote a WebdriverIO test in the Cucumber handler. When I ran it this morning, I got the following error:   </p>
<pre><code>&lt;--- Last few GCs ---&gt;

<p>The error message and some cursory Google searching pointed towards a memory problem, so I started looking at increasing the memory limit. However, this turned out to be a waste of time since the problem was quite simple:   </p>
<p><strong>Selenium Grid wasn&#39;t running on my server.</strong> I started it up and everything worked fine.   </p>
<p>Bugs like this are frustrating because, if the error message had been &quot;can&#39;t connect to Selenium Grid server&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t have taken any of my time to resolve. Hopefully though, now that I&#39;ve documented it, other people can find this on Google and not waste <em>their</em> time trying to fiddle with memory allocations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#39;t remember the last time I wrote any New Year&#39;s resolutions. I must&#39;ve done so when I was a kid, but I really can&#39;t remember any. Anyhow, I&#39;ve decided to write some this year to help me keep on track.   </p>
<p>A lot of New Year&#39;s resolutions are too vague. Things like &quot;Get fit&quot;, &quot;Spend less time on Facebook&quot;, &quot;Be nicer to Mike&quot;. Whilst we can all get on board with the sentiment behind them (poor Mike has had a rough year), they&#39;re not very easy to achieve because they&#39;re not measurable. I&#39;ve learnt from work that if you don&#39;t have a strategy for measuring the success of a project it&#39;s barely worth doing it, so I&#39;m determined to make my resolutions measurable and attainable.   </p>
<ol>
<li>Win the war on terrorism.   </li>
</ol>
<p>JK. Edgy.   </p>
<p>But focussing on measurable goals does come at the cost that my resolutions don&#39;t really sum up my intentions for the year. Obviously I want to be healthier, more sociable and nicer—and these resolutions should help be get there—but that personal development is the sum total of all the little things I do.   </p>

<p>Either on this site, or on <a href="https://medium.com/@gregtyler">my Medium profile</a>. Writing is therapeutic and helps you think in a different, analytical way.

<p>Surprisingly, I came up with this in Nicaragua whilst in a bar playing Harold Lloyd&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Heaven's_Sake_(1926_film)">For Heaven&#39;s Sake</a>. It&#39;s not Lloyd&#39;s best but it&#39;s still an excellent film with that enduring charm that only really exists in silent movies. I used to love silent films, but haven&#39;t watched many recently. In 2016 I want to watch a bunch to remind myself how much I enjoy them. This is also a great opportunity to share the films with other people and introduce them to the silent world.   </p>

<p>I have an idea for a podcast that I&#39;m keeping under wraps at the moment. I&#39;ve talked for years about recording a podcast and this particular idea really seems to me to have legs. This resolution will hopefully force my hand a bit and get me to give the idea a fair crack.   </p>

<p>Not in one sitting, hopefully.   </p>
<p>I played a fair amount of badminton in the start of 2015, but fell away from it later in the year. It&#39;s a good sport and I don&#39;t get enough exercise, so this should get me going!   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/2014-year-in-review/s">I suggested</a> that 2015 would be the year of &quot;doing something new&quot;. For the first time in a while, I think I might have missed that target. I did new things in 2015, for sure, but I never managed to find something new to really <em>focus</em> on. However, I leave 2015 full of ideas so I can just push that plan back another year.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1154" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignfull"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1154" class="size-full wp-image-1154" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/edinburgh-panoramic.jpg" alt="Panorama of Edinburgh" width="2048" height="308" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/edinburgh-panoramic.jpg 2048w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/edinburgh-panoramic-300x45.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/edinburgh-panoramic-768x116.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/edinburgh-panoramic-625x94.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1154" class="wp-caption-text">Still living in Edinburgh; still loving this city.

<p>I moved back into more central Edinburgh in the summer, having spent a year in the suburbs and finding a mixture of peaceful and isolating. It&#39;s nice being back in the fray and being able to do things, though I&#39;ve noticed my free time fall away sharply as all of Edinburgh&#39;s best distractions now sit on my doorstep.   </p>
<p>I still work at the University in the same development role with the Student Systems Partnership, making websites to support the administrative functions of the institution. We&#39;ve had a busy year with some really worthwhile projects. Whilst our respect in the university grows though, we continue to try and find our place in the development scene. As we&#39;ve started this year, we will continue to try and push the limitations of our environment whilst declaring consistency and standards-based development.   </p>
<p>I went to two conferences this year. At <a href="http://jqueryuk.com/2015/">jQuery UK</a> I had the chance to meet professionals from across the country and talk about how we&#39;re all approaching the same problems. The talks were all fascinating and consistently well delivered (you can read my write-up of the <a href="https://blog.swdev.ed.ac.uk/2015/03/11/jquery-uk-morning-sessions/">morning</a> and <a href="https://blog.swdev.ed.ac.uk/2015/03/11/jquery-uk-afternoon-sessions/">afternoon</a> sessions), but I think the greatest value came from talking to other delegates and getting a feel for the landscape outside our higher education bubble. I&#39;ll be going back to the conference—now renamed Render—this year.   </p>
<p>The other conference I attended was the much more corporate <a href="http://www.tribalgroup.com/aboutus/events/Pages/SITSVisionAnnualCustomerConference2015.aspx">SITS:Vision Annual Customer Conference</a> (SITS:Vision being the software platform we use in the University). The conference was a great opportunity to meet fellow university developers and staff from Tribal, the supplier. It made me feel much more part of the wider SITS community and gave me much greater appreciation for the scale of the operation being run out of Hull. I also had the opportunity to talk at a very well attended session about JavaScript, which was very exciting.   </p>
<p>I still continue to help run the quiz in the Dagda Bar every other Tuesday, and think I can now say I&#39;ve now successfully transitioned from student quizzes to adult ones. The differences are obvious but notable. I&#39;ve truly been made welcome there.   </p>
<p>I went to three weddings this year, and have at least one more lined up for 2016. It&#39;s both exciting and terrifying watching people I&#39;ve shared so many immature experiences with go through such a serious transition. But it&#39;s always nice to catch up with everyone. All the best to those couples and the ones who will tie the knot in the coming year.   </p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve done incredibly well for live music this year, starting with seeing <a href="http://postmodernjukebox.com/">Postmodern Jukebox</a> in The Queen&#39;s Hall, a venue now just around the corner from my flat. Also locally, I recently saw the Scottish National Opera&#39;s production of Carmen in Festival Theatre. The SNO always put on a good show and they didn&#39;t disappoint this year either.   </p>
<p>Further afield, I went to see <a href="http://www.aboveandbeyond.nu/">Above and Beyond</a>—one of my favourite bands—in Manchester in April. I met up with Ed and we had a great weekend of drinking, hanging out, and listening to music. Above and Beyond were excellent and the whole evening was super fun. It was the first time in a long time seeing an artist that I&#39;ve really loved, and seeing someone with such international appeal, and definitely encouraged me to see more live music.   </p>
<p>Following Manchester, I went to two music festivals. I volunteered at smaller <a href="http://www.edenfestival.co.uk/MAIN/">Eden</a>, which was a very relaxed and chilled out event. Eden had an incredible line-up and I wasn&#39;t disappointed by a single set. It also introduced me to a lot of bands that I&#39;ve since really got into and am on the lookout to see again (Undercover Hippy has already been checked off the &quot;see again&quot; list; The Cat Empire is booked).   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.kendalcalling.co.uk/lineup/2015/">Kendal Calling</a> was also great fun; though we weren&#39;t as lucky with the weather. Seeing Snoop Dogg in the Lake District was a unique experience and the rest of the line-up was, like Eden, full of great acts. My one misgiving with Kendal Calling was that its size made it difficult to schedule plans since acts I was interested in often conflicted, and the tastes were much more diverse (and not always to my liking).   </p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1177" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-barcelona.jpg" alt="Me in Barcelona" width="511" height="681" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-barcelona.jpg 511w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-barcelona-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" />
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>Like music, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever managed to dedicate a section to &quot;travel&quot; in a previous year-in-review. But in 2015 I&#39;ve been all over the world and it&#39;s totally punctuated the year. I&#39;ll list destinations from close-to-far.   </p>
<p>I went to the <a href="http://www.peebleshydro.co.uk/">Peebles Hydro hotel</a> with Amy&#39;s family to celebrate her grandparents&#39; wedding anniversary. It was a lovely weekend of variously socialising, exercising and dining. Peebles Hydro is a lovely place, and has a real Agatha Christie aesthetic to it.   </p>
<p>In June I spent a week in Shetland with my parents and some family friends. We&#39;ve been to Shetland before (and are going back next year), but it&#39;s an awesome place. Great walking, lovely people, and a very special atmosphere. We didn&#39;t go to the Northern isles this time so I couldn&#39;t continue my search for <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/britains-most-northerly-sheep/">Britain&#39;s Most Northerly Sheep</a>, but I had an excellent time walking the hills and dales (even if my flight <em>was</em> cancelled and I had to ferry back).   </p>
<p>In April I spent a long weekend in Barcelona with Amy. I love the culture and atmosphere of Barcelona; it&#39;s a beautiful city full of amazing sites and wonderful people. I&#39;m constantly impressed by how keen Spaniards are to let you speak Spanish, no matter how broken it is. As well as seeing some of the top attractions, like the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, we had a lovely time wandering the streets and finding the hidden treasures of the city.   </p>
<p>Finally, I went to Mexico and Nicaragua for two weeks in December. I could write books about my time there, it was just incredible. Both are amazing countries steeped in fascinating history and full of diversions. We did so much in those two weeks that, looking back, I can&#39;t see how we fit it all in such a short time. I don&#39;t want to go too into the trip because I&#39;ve spent the past two weeks detailing it to everyone I&#39;ve met and could easily double the size of this post and this late a point. But I will say that if you&#39;re considering travelling to Central America then I highly recommend the area as a destination and specifically would recommend Nicaragua as a country that really offers a little bit of everything.   </p>
<p>![Me in Nicaragua](/me-in-nicaragua.jpg &quot;:centre The customary &quot;pretending to be planes in turbulence&quot; photo in Laguna Apoyo.&quot;)</p>
<p>So 2015 has been completely rad. And whilst my dreams of producing something new weren&#39;t fulfilled, the music and travel have shown me totally new worlds of excitement. Plans for next year? For the first time since being a kid, I&#39;ll be writing up some resolutions to lead me forward in a future blog post.</p>

      <pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2015 10:44:24 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently presented with the following error in Chrome DevTools:   </p>
<pre><code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }</code></pre>
<p>Along with this being a very vague error, the link in DevTools that typically takes you to the script with the error instead took me to the first line of the HTML document where, of course, there&#39;s no JavaScript.   </p>
<p>I did a bit of searching around and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4491533/unexpected-token">this Stack Overflow post</a> which suggests that it&#39;s not a syntax error in my JavaScript files, but something that&#39;s being generated or handled elsewhere.   </p>
<p>To investigate further, I used the &quot;Pause on exceptions&quot; feature of DevTools&#39;s Sources tab, which immediately stops execution at the point of error, and highlights where in the stack and source code it currently is.   </p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1149" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-pause-on-error.png" alt="" width="485" height="513" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-pause-on-error.png 485w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-pause-on-error-284x300.png 284w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" />
<p>As can be seen in the attached picture, the error was occurring during a call jQuery&#39;s <code>parseJSON</code> function from by own <code>builder.start</code>. This led me to find that <code>builder.start</code> was trying to parse some JSON from a data attribute which had been malformed (<code>{supervisor:}</code>). Fixing that JSON speedily removed the syntax error.   </p>
<p>So if you come across this sort of &quot;ghost&quot; error, it might be a problem with your JSON. More importantly, try using DevTool&#39;s <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging#pause-on-exceptions">Pause on exceptions</a> to try and get to the bottom of it.   </p>
<h2 id="other-browsers">Other browsers</h2>
<p>After fixing the problem, I recreated it to see how other browsers&#39; developer tools would handle it. Internet Explorer fairs slightly better than Chrome, at least narrowing down the error to the jQuery file. The trace link just takes you to the last line of the file though.   </p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1151" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-ie.png" alt="" width="419" height="226" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-ie.png 419w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-ie-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" />
<p>Firefox is more helpful, noting directly the function in the call stack at the time the error occurred and the position in the JSON where the parsing failed. The trace link is also much more accurate but, because Firefox Developer Tools don&#39;t handle JavaScript files very well yet, clicking through to the minified file is only accurate to the line.   </p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1150" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-firefox.png" alt="" width="789" height="267" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-firefox.png 789w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-firefox-300x102.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-firefox-768x260.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/devtools-syntax-error-firefox-625x212.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript has a function <code>window.close()</code> which, under certain circumstances, will close the current window. However sometimes you&#39;ll run into an error like:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this situation, your helpful &quot;close this window&quot; buttons don&#39;t work.   </p>
<p>We have exactly this in situation in a current project I work on, where we ask people to open a link in a new tab so that <code>window.close()</code> will take them back out of it.   </p>
<p>The problem we had was knowing when <code>window.close()</code> will work. If you open a new window with JavaScript (using <code>window.open()</code> no less) then it you&#39;re fine. But if you right click and open in a new tab, then submit a form, it won&#39;t be happy. So when is a window closable?   </p>
<p>My first thought was the <code>opener</code> property of <code>window</code> which presumably would hint at where the window came from and &#8211; hence &#8211; what can close it. So I made a table of various difference situations which I experimented with in each of the major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE). Find the table below and some terminology explained beneath it.   </p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br />&quot;Child&quot; means that the user was taken straight to a page with a close button on it. &quot;Through form&quot; means they were taken to a page which had a form submission before the close page. &quot;Through link&quot; means that they were taken to a page with a link to the close page.   </p>
<p>&quot;(_blank)&quot; means that the window was opened using an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with the <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code> attribute. &quot;(JS)&quot; means that the window was opened with the <code>window.open</code> function. All other examples were <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags with no attributes.   </p>
<p>The colour of each cell is whether or not it could successfully be closed. The text denotes the value of <code>window.opener</code>. Where the text is &quot;N&quot;, this value was <code>null</code>, where it is &quot;W&quot; it returned a <code>window</code> object. Where it is &quot;U&quot;, it returned <code>undefined</code>.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer always prompts you to confirm the window closure.   </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learnt-">What have we learnt?</h2>
<p>Firstly, Internet Explorer is noticeably unusual. It returns <code>undefined</code> rather than <code>null</code> and then lets you close the window no matter what situation you&#39;re in (though with a prompt). Secondly, and important for my situation, asking people to open a new tab doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ll be able to close it. As soon as they follow a link or submit a form, both Firefox and Internet Explorer lose control.   </p>
<p>In a goal to find some sort of check whether a window is closable, I can recommend the following from my results:   </p>
<pre><code class="language-js">if( typeof window.opener === &#39;object&#39; &amp;&amp; window.opener instanceof Window ) {
    // We can certainly use window.close
} else {
    // We can&#39;t be sure window.close will work
}</code></pre>
<p>This is (from the experience above) a cross-browser way to be certain that <code>window.close</code> will work, without any browser sniffing.   </p>
<p>Are my figures right? Any views on this? Comment below!</p>

      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 17:13:19 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve written my annual <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/2014-year-in-review/">personal Year in Review</a>, but this year I wanted to touch upon some issues that haven&#39;t necessarily affected me or my work directly, but have nonetheless affected my year.   </p>
<p>I&#39;m not a professional writer, journalist, nor political pundit. These vague views are just what I&#39;ve come to feel at the end of the year. Take them all at face value, and feel free to point out if anything is erroneous.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t like to lead with a negative tone but, from a global perspective, 2014 has really sucked. Simple mentions of words like &quot;Ebola&quot;, &quot;Ukraine&quot; and &quot;Ferguson&quot; bring to mind grave and complex stories from the past 12 months. Even our two great sporting events of the year have been overshadowed. Both the World Cup and the Winter Olympics were supposed to be great opportunities to connect with two countries which are on the up, but the first was marred by controversies in a now overtly corrupt FIFA and the second by Russian homophobia and land invasions.   </p>
<p>Closer to heart, the previously escapist hobby of playing video games was over-run by often misappropriated &quot;controversies&quot; which dominated gaming discussion and press. What was previously a place of openness was turned into a hotbed for harassment and misogyny, and endless condemnations of the selfsame harassment and misogyny. An entire culture was spoiled, not by GamerGate and not by &quot;SJWs&quot;, but by constant bickering and fighting to stay relevant.   </p>
<p>Ultimately, to my mind, this has all been the fault of poor reactionary journalism, an unintelligible thirst for controversial stories which bring in more readers, more viewers and more money. Online journalism has succumbed to the syndrome of Buzzfeed and Upworthy, trying to reshape itself to align with their profitable models, riding the curtails of the young audience they pick up, and damned to the fact that this isn&#39;t news any more.   </p>
<p>In 2015, I want to see a return to traditional news-telling. I want to see stories researched and confirmed properly before being put online, with a weak apology issued the next day stating how it was an &quot;editorial oversight&quot; which inadvertently earned thousands of pounds of revenue in advertising money that shan&#39;t be repaid. I want to see the news not trying to be relevant and hip, to stop pandering to people by covering inconsequential stories on topics like Minecraft and &quot;James from Vine&quot; in an attempt to corral people to start visiting their site.   </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to see more grass-roots journalism, more explanations from the field which aren&#39;t over-blown reports composed by someone thousands of miles away who has a frame in mind for the story already. I finally see the point of something like the upcoming <a href="http://www.infobitt.com/">Infobitt</a> which, whilst not looking perfect, seems to be a step in the right direction. And I want to see the general public holding the news reporting outlets honest, challenging bad and unethical practices. Why are resources like Private Eye to be the only ones to report on, for example, favourable coverage based on business deals?   </p>
<p>Over the past few years (and undoubtedly for longer since) online journalism has turned from being informative to being crass entertainment. Too much time is spent pushing agendas, attacking groups with whom the writer disagrees, and with whom they think their readership should disagree with too. And too often this descends into little more than personal attacks, manufactured outrage, and an altogether false reality that exists only to help validate previously held beliefs.   </p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s been a funny year for politics too. In declaring their outrage at the ever-growing UKIP, the press helped propel them even further up the pecking order. We may look back at say that UKIP have gained such much traction this year because of their strong results in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)">European elections</a> but, frankly, they gained traction because every left-wing media outlet spent months beforehand issuing front-page headlines that only bolstered their following.   </p>
<p>Not to contradict my point and further draw attention to UKIP, but I get where their following is coming from. Despite believing that Nigel Farage is a nasty piece of work and his party will do nothing but drive our country back in unexpected and turbulent ways, I have to credit them with stepping in at a time when people are disillusioned and provide a fairly believable alternative. I <em>like</em> Farage&#39;s image. He&#39;s not an Oxbridge-educated tosspot, but someone who seems (somewhat uniquely in the field) like a genuine human being. He seems more interested in talking his mind than protecting his image which, even though I agree with his mind, I want to see more of in the political world.   </p>
<p>The only other vaguely affable person in politics this year has been Russell Brand who can certainly be credited with getting younger people interested in the field, but with little more. Brand talks with long words and archaic language, presumably to appear intelligent, but instead comes across like a pantomime character from the 1800s.   </p>
<p>With both Farage and Brand, I completely see where they come from and why they&#39;re needed in the spectrum right now. I want more accessible politicians in our country, I just wish they were more agreeable. Perhaps next year we&#39;ll see the appearance of some people who fit into both categories, who can be genial, intelligent and hold an argument without shouting or falling back to insults. I&#39;d really like to be able to vote for someone I <em>genuinely believe in</em> in an upcoming election.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/2013-year-in-review/s">I stated</a> that 2014 was likely to be a year for settling down a bit, and that&#39;s been perfectly true. I&#39;ve stayed in Edinburgh for all of 2014, moving a bit further out of town to quieter suburbs away from the busier city centre. A double-edged sword, this has led to more consideration about how I spend my evenings since (for example) I have to walk more than 100 metres to get to a bar now.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1186" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1186" class="size-full wp-image-1186" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/old-college.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/old-college.jpg 1024w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/old-college-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/old-college-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/old-college-625x417.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1186" class="wp-caption-text">The lovely Old College, where I now work. (Credit: [dun_deagh on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dun_deagh/7007920283))</p></div>
<p>I&#39;ve stayed working for the University of Edinburgh, but changed teams to work on more student-focussed projects. This has been a happy move particularly because, as a recent graduate, the student experience is very close to my heart. In 2014 I helped release the Course Timetable Browser and updates to the Undergraduate admissions system and the course management processes. I was also part of making Path University-wide, and it has continued to grow massively to become a recognised part of the University infrastructure. Path&#39;s now much further out of my hands, which is frankly a blessing as it means I can spend time working on developing other major projects rather than things like support and training.   </p>
<p>Outside of my full-time work, I&#39;ve spent less time this year on other websites. The ominously titled &quot;London Project&quot; has taken up quite a lot of my time, and I&#39;ve been really happy with the development despite some typical teething issues. Me and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulhorrocks">Paul</a> officially disbanded Croft Media this year, which comes with a twinge of sadness but is frankly a sensible decision considering how much we have on at the moment.   </p>
<p>In 2014 I also finally said goodbye to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pleasancepubquiz">Pleasance Quiz</a>, having sat at the front for three fantastic years (and, of course, having taken part for two before that). It&#39;s been sad to leave the quiz behind, but the preparation time was getting in the way of other activities, and travelling across town to attend each week would&#39;ve been a much larger burden. I&#39;m very lucky to see Angus continue at Pleasance, and a very capable friend has taken my position; so I could confidently leave the place in safe hands.   </p>
<p>Soon after leaving Pleasance, I became a regular attendee at the quiz at The Dagda Bar, which is slightly more grown-up and noticeably more challenging! On occasion I&#39;ve been seen hosting too, which helps scratch that itch for asking people questions and making poor jokes to a room full of people who&#39;ll chuckle politely.   </p>
<p>As with last year, the summer brought a new wave of people moving out of Edinburgh. It&#39;s a shame to see people go, particularly after seeing many of them regularly for the past five years. However, changing departments at work has introduced to a whole load of exceptional new people, some of whom I went to Aviemore with this autumn.   </p>
<p>Of course, there&#39;s far more to mention socially that I don&#39;t want to go into as much detail with. The Fringe was as enjoyable as ever, and I saw some fantastic acts. I&#39;ve had some great nights out with friends and colleagues, from fancy restaurants to seedy nightclubs. My music tastes have both refined and broadened, and I&#39;ve started making much more effort to watch interesting films that I might not have considered before.   </p>

<p>Ultimately, despite being less exciting that 2013, I&#39;ve had a perfectly pleasant year. I&#39;ve met lots of amazing people and had great experiences with them all. I&#39;ve certainly settled a bit, and got more used to the world of work that I&#39;m destined to inhabit from here on out. Going forward, I think 2015 is going to be the year of doing something new. I&#39;m not sure what I want to focus on yet, but this time next year I expect there&#39;s going to be at least one thing that I&#39;m especially proud of.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Jack Frost, Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy team up to fight for children&#39;s belief against the assuredly-British and delectably-evil Pitch Black.</em>   </p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Part way through the film it&#39;s dropped that the majority of the events take place at Easter. However, with Jack Frost&#39;s main powers being related to snow and ice, and the large helping of appearances from Santa Claus, it&#39;s hard not to think of this as a Christmas film. For sure, we&#39;ve learnt that Michigan gets more than its fair share of cold weather.   </p>
<p>Of course, Christmas spirit is more than just featuring tropes from the festive season. The real weight of Christmas comes from bringing people together, spreading joy and happiness, and seeking to make good on your mistakes over the previous year. These are all things that <em>Rise</em> deals with, as we see Jack Frost not only discover himself, but find a new group of friends who he likes and respects, and with whom he&#39;ll seek to bring further joy and mirth to the world.   </p>
<p>Christmas too is about entertaining children, so animated films with funny characters kind of automatically get a free pass.   </p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Being an animated film, I&#39;m jointly judging the voicework, animation and character design here.   </p>
<p>Alec Baldwin stands out as MVP for voice casting. He excels as the beefy, tattooed and clearly Russian Santa Claus, bringing a perfect mixture of charm and wisdom to the role. He also sounds nothing like the Alec Baldwin we&#39;ve known <em>30 Rock</em> or <em>Hunt for the Red October</em>. (For those intrigued, you can witness some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jki3jZRi3eY&#038;t=79">in-the-booth action</a>.)   </p>
<p>Jude Law also excels as the antagonist of the flick, Pitch Black. With his very over-pronounced accent, he reminds us of quite how well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bls1KKDwmo">Brits can fit the bad-guy role</a>. The rest of the cast are perfectly suitable, though don&#39;t stand out as much as those two. Hugh Jackman plays the (Australian) Easter Bunny, Isla Fisher fills the role of the Tooth Fairy and various children play the supporting cast.   </p>
<p>The characters themselves are delightful. The interpretation of Santa particularly stands out to me: he&#39;s a bit more rugged, more brutish, than we&#39;re used to, yet he is still clearly driven my bringing joy to the children of the world. Ultimately, it&#39;s nice to see someone mix up the formula a bit, and to do it so well. Equally, much more character is brought to the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, which all fits in with the highly stylised world that they inhabit.   </p>
<p>In animated films, there are often smaller characters who travel in large packs and add some comic value to the scenario (this is most played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323594/">Despicable Me</a> which puts these minions front and centre). <em>Rise</em> is no different, boasting four such underling creations: Yetis, elves, fairies and walking Easter eggs. All of them are adorable and, per their role, make up some of the funniest visual and one-shot gags. My favourite of the bunch are the yeti, who have some fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f9hfuD9bec">anatomical design and animation</a>.   </p>

<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ If I had kids, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to show them this. Batting it at a PG for &quot;mild threat and language&quot;, it&#39;s suitable for the whole family and a whole lot of fun to boot. Whilst clearly being aimed at the children&#39;s market, there&#39;s a lot of enjoyment to be had for all, and the group of 20-somethings I watched it with had several laugh-out-loud moments.   </p>
<p><em>Rise</em> plays on the idea of children believing in characters like Santa, resolving that &#8211; even if you can&#39;t see them all the time &#8211; you should have faith that they&#39;ll be there for you when you need them. It takes a supernatural approach to each of the characters and ultimately provides a good moral message to not losing faith in something you believe in because of one small hiccup.   </p>
<p>More importantly, it&#39;s cute as all heck.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ No Christmas music, because the film doesn&#39;t actually take place at Christmas.   </p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I had a really good time with this film. It&#39;s not going to go down as a huge classic, but it&#39;s a really solid animated film that I&#39;m surprised I&#39;d never heard of before. This is the best family film we&#39;ve had in a long time.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ben Affleck steals his dead friend&#39;s pen-pal girlfriend by pretending to be him, then goes on a heist to rob a Michigan casino on Christmas Eve with her brother. It&#39;s a catalogue of awful, awful decisions.</em>   </p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Let&#39;s start with the good parts. It certainly is set at Christmas, and there&#39;s a whole lot of snow. This may seem like pretty standard Christmas stuff, but you&#39;d be surprised how overlooked it can be. The heist itself takes place on Christmas Eve, and the gang all dress as Santas. Why? Because &quot;you won&#39;t be able to just walk in there and take the money&quot;. The logical is fallible, but the Christmas relationship is pretty darn inescapable.   </p>
<p>There&#39;s also a moral at the end (I shan&#39;t spoil it), and we see the final character doing a spot of Christmas good will (still dressed as Santa) as they deliver gifts throughout the neighbourhood. These vague connotations almost seem as if the film was written to <em>try</em> and awkwardly score points on categories decided by this humble blogger. But since the movie outdates my Christmas reviews by thirteen years, I think we&#39;ll have to accept that that&#39;s not the case.   </p>
<p>Now, the less Christmas-spirited elements. <em>Reindeer Games</em> starts in prison, where Rudy&#39;s (Ben Affleck&#39;s) cellmate is yammering on about the girl he&#39;s been writing to who&#39;s meeting him when they get out. Rudy makes some wisecracks, but is clearly jealous that he&#39;s not got any sweet-loving to meet him on the other side of the gates. The day before their release, in a food fight caused by cockroaches appearing in the food (it&#39;s not ever explained how), the cellmate takes a shiv for Rudy like the absolute champ he is. Our protagonist owes his <em>life</em> to the guy, and will surely set the world to rights when he meets his sweet freedom.   </p>
<p>Nope, he pretends to be his dead cellmate so he can sleep with the girl.   </p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to like Affleck&#39;s character after that point. It&#39;s Christmas you heathen!   </p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ It&#39;s a harsh reality, but Ben Affleck doesn&#39;t shine in this film. Charlize Theron does though. She starts off as a very vanilla character but, as we discover more about the background story, Theron really sells up Ashley&#39;s development. It&#39;s a controlled performance, not trying to run forward and not being stuck behind.   </p>
<p>Gary Sinise is great too. More recently known for his almost 200-episode stint in the CSI franchise, <em>Reindeer Games</em> takes place when Sinise was a key player in Hollywood. His role as Gabriel, the psychotic gun-runner who wants to enter the criminal big leagues, is right on point. In fact, his performance is so good that it distracted me throughout the film.   </p>
<p>I&#39;d also like to mention that Danny Trejo shows up in this film making him, after his appearance in <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/a-very-harold-kumar-3d-christmas/">Harold &amp; Kumar 3</a>, the first person to feature in back-to-back Christmas reviews. As is traditional of the time, he basically plays the role of Danny Trejo. Vin Diesel was supposed to be in the film too, which maybe would&#39;ve pushed this up to five stars. Sadly, as far as I&#39;m aware, Diesel is yet to put out a Christmas film. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRfluEAFvU">This video</a> is perhaps the closest we&#39;ll come to seeing &quot;The Christmases of Riddick&quot;.   </p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ There is a section of the film where we&#39;re led to believe that incest is being committed by two of the lead characters. Generally speaking, this is a red flag on the ol&#39; &quot;family fun&quot; section. You wouldn&#39;t expect to find incest in something like, say, <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/polar-express/">The Polar Express</a>.   </p>
<p>There&#39;s also gratuitous amounts of violence (some very graphic), as various characters are stabbed, shot and otherwise eradicated from the Earth. Plus extremely frequent swearing, and the harsh realities of prison in the opening scenes. There&#39;s no full-on nudity but Charlize Theron is topless a couple of times and we get some lovely angles of Ben Affleck&#39;s butt (or whoever was standing in for him that day) whilst they screw in a motel room (reminder: he&#39;s stolen the identity of his <strong>dead cellmate</strong>). Classy.   </p>
<p>Despite all of this, the BBFC deemed the film a 15 for &quot;strong violence and language, and one scene of moderate sex&quot;, making it accessible to various members of the family. Probably not a stocking filler, but if your dad or teenage brother caught it on channel five late at night, they&#39;d certainly make it to the end.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Minimal. Effort. Made.   </p>
<p>In one scene we hear &quot;Let It Snow&quot; and a few times Ben Affleck is caught whistling a Christmas tune that I can&#39;t remember the name of. Don&#39;t be fooled though, this is Christmassy only in an attempt to sell it for the 1999 festive season (though it was delayed for re-shoots because test audiences didn&#39;t like it).   </p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆<br />It&#39;s not great. You can&#39;t help but hate the main character, and that really distracts from the rest of the story. Frankly, in the end, you don&#39;t want anyone to come out of it having won. That said, the action is entertaining in that way that action films can be, and the Christmas Eve Santa heist is a concept I&#39;d love to see a better film take on.   </p>
<p>I said it in the cover, but this film really does have a lot of twists. You have to constantly re-evaluate your predictions of what&#39;s going to happen next.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#39;s another drug-filled journey as our two favourite stoners now try and save Christmas.</em>   </p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ I&#39;m guessing this is one of the ones I&#39;m going to have arguments about.   </p>
<p>Something I often consider in this category of how central a role Christmas plays in the plot and narrative. Inarguably, in _3D Christmas_, the festive season is key to everything that&#39;s going on. The plot centres around the acquisition of a suitable Christmas tree, and the timeframe is set by the family being out at midnight mass. Christmas parties, gifts and Santa then play a central role.   </p>
<p>The message of the film is set through Harold&#39;s development, as he realises that the important thing about Christmas is to be with family and friends, to forgive others and yourself; and how sweating the details is a needless distraction in this goal. In the end all the characters have a great Christmas, despite all they&#39;ve been through, because they&#39;re all together. That, to my mind, is what Christmas is all about.   </p>
<p>However, I see pot more as a summer drug.   </p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ John Cho and Kal Penn have been through a lot since their original drug-infused trip to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Whitecastle</a>. Cho has done the acting rounds, featuring as Sulu in the 2009 Star Trek rebirth and its sequel (as well as featuring across scores of films and television series). Meanwhile Penn, having spent two season on _House_, has taken up the position of Associate Director at the White House Office of Public Engagement. As such, it&#39;s really impressive to see them both reprise such irreverent roles.   </p>
<p>There are some strong references to the development of the past years from Adrian (CollegeHumor&#39;s Amir Blumenfeld) who remarks of Harold &quot;Can we drop this tree off at Sulu&#39;s and head to the city?&quot; and explains to Kumar that &quot;I told her you work for the White House&quot;, with the Associate Director responding &quot;Yeah, like anyone&#39;s gonna believe that.&quot;   </p>
<div id="attachment_1134" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1134" class="size-full wp-image-1134" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/3d-christmas-going-up.jpg" alt="Cast of A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/3d-christmas-going-up.jpg 1920w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/3d-christmas-going-up-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/3d-christmas-going-up-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/3d-christmas-going-up-625x352.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1134" class="wp-caption-text">Going up? John Cho and Kal Penn (middle) reprise their roles as Harold and Kumar, joined this time out by Thomas Lennon (left) and Amir Blumenfeld (right)</p></div>
<p>We also see a return of Neil Patrick Harris, who does a fantastic job of playing a character who&#39;s less of a self-parody and more of a complete reversal, shunning his homosexuality (he came out after the original Harold &amp; Kumar) as a ruse &quot;for the p-tang&quot;. Harris&#39;s real-life partner David Burtka also features this time around, further cementing the pretension that their relationship is a sham. He&#39;s a really fun character that NPH brings a strange believability to.   </p>
<p>There&#39;s also Danny Trejo, as Harold&#39;s nightmare father-in-law. This is a genius bit of casting, as Trejo moves between his traditional, aggressive hard-man image, and that of a doting father who loves Christmas. Seeing him smile at the sight of a Christmas tree is the most unnerving moment of the production. In fact, I&#39;d put this up as one of Trejo&#39;s best films. It&#39;s no _Machete_, but he totally owns the character.   </p>
<p>The rest of the background cast is strong too. Amir Blumenfeld makes a great debut, Rosenberg and Goldstein return briefly for a few laughs, and Jake Johnson (him off _New Girl_) and Patton Oswalt make solid cameos. Wafflebot is very enjoyable too, proving a key member of the ensemble.   </p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ <em>3D Christmas</em> is an 18, which fairly promptly rules out the original intention of this category. For those wondering, and presumably not paying attention, the BBFC cites the reasoning as &quot;contains frequent drug use&quot; which, considering a young child has a bad cocaine trip, isn&#39;t one bit surprising.   </p>
<p>What brings the marks up slightly here is that I honestly think the humour, clearly aimed at the teenage/stoner audience, has some legs. There are plenty of jokes my dad (who is very much not a teenager or stoner) would find very entertaining and, liberal sex/drug-humour aside, the tone of the film is very warm and cheery. Even when not hilarious, it&#39;s amusing.   </p>
<p>I would note though that it&#39;s not a film for the &quot;easily offended&quot; or even the &quot;moderately easily offended&quot;. But, heck, that doesn&#39;t mean <em>some</em> of the family won&#39;t appreciate it.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ You know, there are a lot of Christmas tunes in <em>3D Christmas</em>. It opens with &quot;It&#39;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot; and ends on &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;. More importantly, it doesn&#39;t mess with them. By which I mean, it doesn&#39;t do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU7bD1O1Quc">this</a> horrible comedic trope of interrupting a piece of music to make a contrast. Like I said in the first section of this review, the Christmas spirit is honestly heartfelt.   </p>
<p>There&#39;s also a solid soundtrack, which features what I always refer to as the &quot;Die Hard school of Christmas music&quot;, where traditional tunes are merged into the soundtrack. For example, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4E6WxCnSXTnatOhejnL3GW">this track (Spotify)</a> which merges Carol of the Bells with a heist theme. For me, this sort of composition is always a <em>huge</em> win in this category.   </p>
<p>And on top of all of that, a lot of the soundtrack features sleigh bells. What more could you want?   </p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I&#39;m honestly surprised. I was delaying this one because I assumed I&#39;d hate it. On the surface, it&#39;s a cheap cash-in on the popular franchise, the readily-accessible Christmas movie market and the rise of the 3D gimmick (which is self-referenced a few times). But it&#39;s funny, nice and carries a sincere message. The humour is certainly not everyone&#39;s tastes, but if you enjoy lewd irreverent humour then this might just be the Christmas film for you.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the way, Langston <em>does</em> interact with some fairly familiar characters: Jo-Jo and Maria are having a child, a chap named Isaiah on the bus reveals some harsh truths about feeling like a motherless child (more on this later), and someone called Angel stops him from walking out in front of a taxi. But these feel so shoe-horned in that it&#39;s distracting even during the film. Isaiah and Angel both disappear after these interactions, only to return in the final dream sequence (Angel with a huge pair of wings, of course), and it reeks as if the writer really wanted to write about learning something from faith but didn&#39;t really know <em>what</em>.   </p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker, Academy Award nominee Angela Bassett, Grammy Award winner Jennifer Hudson, AMA winner Tyrese Gibson and nine times Grammy Award winner Mary J. Blige. This isn&#39;t your kid&#39;s nativity production.   </p>
<p>I&#39;ve watched various films that allude to serious problems (for instance, <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/jingle-all-the-way/">Jingle All The Way</a> addresses a work-heavy father&#39;s distant relationship with his son), but <em>Black Nativity</em> is probably the first film on the Christmas list to really tackle something head-on. It&#39;s not a particularly happy film (despite being a Christmas musical, consider that for a moment), so the strength of the cast is an absolute deal-breaker.   </p>
<p>Being a musical, everyone on the team gets a singing part, and the acting-to-singing ratio is well balanced for each performer. Whitaker and Gibson stay more on the acting side, whilst Mary J Blige probably only speaks ten words and sings the rest. Making the cast play to their strengths is, I think, one of the key things that sells this throughout. It&#39;s almost like watching a variety show, where a rap by Nas is quickly followed by a monologue from Forest Whitaker. I&#39;d be thoroughly entertained to see a rebalanced version though, where Gibson does all the singing and MJB only gets a couple of harmonies in.   </p>

Beyond religious imagery, they otherwise don&#39;t fit into the plot at all.</p></div>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ As said above, it&#39;s really not very fun at all. It&#39;s deeply serious and sober; it features one of the most broken families I&#39;ve ever seen; the plot repeatedly suggests it&#39;s about to take a dark turn.   </p>
<p>The film ends with the family uniting together and singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-BgJZp27aI">Be Grateful</a>, though it&#39;s not altogether clear what they&#39;re grateful for. Throughout the song, you don&#39;t feel like it will last or that anyone&#39;s learnt anything. The message is along the lines of &quot;if you&#39;re having problems in your family, just ignore them and be grateful that it could be worse&quot;.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There are some really good songs in here, and plenty of odd ones too. Langston&#39;s first song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1hDEWLhf1M&#038;t=38s">Motherless Child</a>, a traditional Negro spiritual, which really loses its depth when sung with no emotion on a coach. This, however, is quickly followed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2XN_adB2UI">Hush Child (Get You Through This Silent Night)</a> which totally ticks the harmony boxes.   </p>
<p>Also worth noting is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbYYJdiY60E">Rise Up Shepherd and Follow</a>, with Mary J Blige singing the traditional lyrics before Nas cuts in with some of the most out-of-places lyrics of 2013:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I&#39;m the noble one.<br />
The Obi Wan Kenobi one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real musical highlight though comes during the actual play-within-a-play production of Black Nativity where Forest Whitaker gives a passionate and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is4Acf-tphU">highly musical</a> sermon. Featuring a full gospel choir, a really strange robe-change and some solid lighting, it is exactly the sort of service I want to spend my Christmas at.   </p>
<p>NB: The soundtrack is on Spotify, but it&#39;s missing three of the most important songs for reasons I can&#39;t speculate over.   </p>
<p>![Shot of Mary J. Blige](/black-nativity-2.jpg &quot;:centre Mary J. Blige plays a character called &quot;angel&quot;, who gets about two lines and a big number during Langston&#39;s religious epiphany.&quot;)</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br />As expected, this film is deliriously strange. It tackles some serious topics, constantly ramps up in severity and features some solid acting and singing. Yet its ending message is confusing, and I really don&#39;t feel like I took anything away from it. The whole film was entertaining, but I&#39;m certain that&#39;s more by sharing it with others than because of the content itself.   </p>
<p>I&#39;d be really interested to know what others think of this because, several hours later, I&#39;m still really not sure what I did.   </p>
<h2 id="bonus-questions">Bonus questions</h2>
<p><em>Immediately after we finished, I asked the room some questions about what they thought of the film. I took some notes, and paraphrase the following responses:</em>   </p>
<h3 id="is-this-the-best-christmas-film-you-ve-ever-seen-">Is this the best Christmas film you&#39;ve ever seen?</h3>
<p>Abena: Definitely. Best film of all time.<br />Nat: It&#39;s the mother I always dreamed of.<br />Greg: I&#39;m not sure about &quot;Christmas&quot; film. I think it could&#39;ve happened at any time of year.<br />Nat: You can&#39;t have a black nativity at Easter.   </p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-favourite-line-">What was your favourite line?</h3>
<p>Jess: &quot;My holidays / are hollow days.&quot; (Jess continued to repeat this at any prompt she could.)<br />Nat: &quot;You&#39;re called Langston Jones? Like the poet?&quot; [beat] &quot;You know it.&quot;<br />Paul: I would&#39;ve loved him to say &quot;You recognise it.&quot;<br />Abena: There are so many better responses.<br />Greg: &quot;I&#39;m the noble one / the Obi Wan Kenobi one&quot;. I still don&#39;t get it.<br />Nat: I&#39;m unsure of the relevance of Obi Wan Kenobi to my faith, but I&#39;m certainly open to the idea.   </p>
<h3 id="who-was-your-least-favourite-character-">Who was your least favourite character?</h3>
<p>All: Langston.<br />Greg: I just don&#39;t get him. He&#39;s an awful person.<br />Nat: His journey to &quot;this is my Christmas miracle!&quot; was a total mess.<br />Jess: There were certainly some loose ends.<br />Paul: And the timing of his change of heart makes no sense! [He had a religious epiphany, but it didn&#39;t seem to kick in properly until half an hour later when he was trying to buy a gun for reasons we still don&#39;t know.]   </p>
<p>Paul: Actually, Tyson [Langston&#39;s Dad] was pretty awful. He specifically timed to sell his son a gun so that he&#39;d have to leave church in the middle of the service.<br />Greg: He&#39;s a pot-stirrer, that one.   </p>
<h3 id="nat-abena-jess-what-s-your-view-from-a-religious-perspective-">Nat, Abena, Jess, what&#39;s your view from a religious perspective?</h3>
<p>Nat: I&#39;ve never tripped out about a pregnant person walking around New York and ending up giving birth in Tyrese Gibson&#39;s tarpaulin tent. But I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t happen.<br />Abena: Every God reference was like &quot;Yeah, fair enough&quot;.<br />Nat: That reverend was terrible though.<br />Jess: Very hypocritical.<br />Nat: I guess that was the point, but I don&#39;t think he learnt anything.<br />Abena: I disagree, he seemed to take something on board.<br />Nat: See! This film is so deep!   </p>
<p>Jess: Our carol service needs to up its game.<br />Nat: We certainly shouldn&#39;t have called it &quot;white nativity&quot;. And there aren&#39;t enough robe changes.   </p>
<p>Nat: There are some nuggets of Christianity in there. But the film didn&#39;t have a point.<br />Jess: I think it did have a point.<br />Abena: It&#39;s supposed to be about redemption and restoration.<br />Paul: And being grateful&#8230;<br />Nat: Be grateful for your cheating boyfriend, and your hypocrisy!   </p>
<p>Abena: As a Christian, I&#39;m confused what message this was trying to send from a Christian perspective.   </p>
<p>Nat: The only way to fill these hollow days is with Jesus.<br />Jess: Yeah!<br />Abena: Amen!   </p>
<h3 id="nat-paul-as-a-godless-hellbound-what-did-you-make-of-it-">Nat: Paul, as a Godless hellbound, what did you make of it?</h3>
<p>Paul: The message was a combination of being heavy-handed and not being sure what to say. Like being beaten round the head with a sieve.<br />Nat: If you want a clearer message, come to church some time.<br />Paul: I will.<br />Nat: Why not tomorrow?<br />Jess: Come to the carol service!<br />Paul: Ooo.<br />Greg: Is it just traditional carols or are you doing some other songs? Maybe we&#39;ll hear Motherless Child?<br />Paul: Pitch the Mary J Blige/Nas number with the Obi Wan Kenobi line.   </p>
<h3 id="any-thoughts-on-the-direction-technical-production-">Any thoughts on the direction/technical production?</h3>
<p>Abena: I didn&#39;t like the lighting.<br />Paul: They started shining cross-shaped lights on people, in case you didn&#39;t know it was religious. Also, the ways the segued into songs was really bad. Particularly when they would have characters appear together when they were in different places, where most musicals would cut between them.<br />Nat: I&#39;ve seen church productions with better cameras than that was shot on. Traditional film cameras have built-in picture softening, which is something digital cameras lack. That&#39;s what makes it look so wrong.<br />Abena: Oh, <em>that&#39;s</em> what it was!<br />Paul: There were a lot of moments where they&#39;d build up to a song but not convert. So the music would swell, and then he&#39;d just go to bed.<br />Abena: Yeah, that was really weird.<br />Greg: Maybe the Director&#39;s cut has additional songs that they awkwardly cut out.   </p>
<h3 id="so-did-you-learn-anything-">So, did you learn anything?</h3>
<p>Abena: I learnt so much!<br />Nat: To call it transformative is not an understatement.<br />Abena: I learnt who Langston Hughes was.<br />Jess: I learnt a lot from the lyrics. I&#39;ll definitely reuse some of those phrases.<br />All: I learnt to be grateful!<br />Abena: I don&#39;t know where you guys are getting this gratitude idea from.   </p>
<p>Abena: I learnt that a lot can happen in 48 hours. [The timeframe we think the whole film took place over.] Shakespeare was not wrong.<br />Jess: Are you seriously comparing this to Shakespeare?   </p>
<p>Nat: Genuinely I have no idea what the purpose of that film was.<br />Paul: I think they hadn&#39;t thought the ending through so just threw in an open-ended song that could fit into any situation.   </p>
<p>Abena: If we take out the song about being grateful, what have we really learned?<br />Jess: Holidays. Hollow days.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#39;s pretty much what it says on the tin.</em>   </p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ <em>Technically speaking_, this film is an immediate 5/5 on the Christmas spirit front. I mean, it tells the story of a character who literally embodies the term &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;. And for that very reason, _The Nativity Story</em> scores full marks.   </p>
<p>I would note though that the film is deathly serious. It manages to knock in at a PG, but there are absolutely no laughs to be had; just occasional polite nods. In this regard there&#39;s none of the traditional &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;. But, since these story does in fact pre-date Christmas, I think we can let that slide.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1182" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1182" class="size-full wp-image-1182" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/nativity-oscar-isaacs.jpg" alt="Oscar Isaac&#39;s in The Nativity Story" width="300" height="446" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/nativity-oscar-isaacs.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/nativity-oscar-isaacs-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1182" class="wp-caption-text">One of Isaac&#39;s patented mid-distance stare.</p></div>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Everyone in this is a great actor insomuch as I didn&#39;t really recognise them as acting. The majority of the cast are unfamiliar, save perhaps Oscar Isaac, since I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2042568/">Inside Llewyn Davis</a> just the other night. In <em>The Nativity Story</em> he&#39;s particularly notable for his fantastic facial expressions.   </p>
<p>Also, fair shout-out to the three magi, who are totally engrossing and some fantastic banter. Probably against the director&#39;s intention, they seem more like &quot;lads on tour&quot; than &quot;a group of distinguished foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth&quot;.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi"><a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/christmas-2014/">1</a></a> I much prefer that interpretation though. Anyone know of a Christmas film which is built around that idea?   </p>
<p>I very much enjoyed Ciarán Hinds as King Herod too, bringing equal parts menace and equal parts panto character to his role.   </p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Oh, heck no.   </p>
<p><em>The Nativity Story</em> starts with a title crawl containing <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023#en-NIV-19490">Jeremiah 23 5:6</a>. Fun stuff. This is pretty immediately followed by shots of Roman soldiers running around Nazareth killing young boys in case they are the prophecy-filling messiah. Not quite <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/jingle-all-the-way/">Jingle All the Way</a>, eh?   </p>
<p>I suppose if you wanted to educate young &#39;uns on the real story behind Christmas, and the depravity surrounding it, this could be a fantastic family film. Probably not one to gather round the TV for on the 24th though.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Ooh err. There isn&#39;t really much of a soundtrack, though the whole thing ends with a fairly masked version of Silent Night so we can give a single star here!   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I really enjoyed this film. It&#39;s <em>very</em> well produced and, although predictable, tells the story with a unusually serious tone. Imagine if your pre-school&#39;s nativity play was directed by David Fincher; that&#39;s kind of what you have here.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This year&#8217;s Tim Allen Christmas movie (I&#8217;ve still got two of the &#8220;Santa Clause&#8221; series left) marks a dip against last year&#8217;s five-star masterpiece.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Two parents, free from the shackles of their daughter, try and break loose of a traditional Christmas and go on a cruise. This being a film, it of course doesn&#39;t go to plan.</em>   </p>
<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Let&#39;s get something straight here from the off: I&#39;m on Team Cruise. I don&#39;t think Christmas should be about doing the same thing as everyone else, as you do every year. I think we should respect those who want to move away from the commercial side of buying trees, decorations, presents, large meals etc. This film in fact covers a very interesting viewpoint.   </p>
<p>And, for that reason, I&#39;d rate this high on &quot;Christmas spirit&quot;, because our lead couple seem to want to do something altogether very Christmassy: spend time together, away from work and other distractions. However, the turning point in this film &#8211; where their daughter returns and they very suddenly have to get in the swing of Noël &#8211; completely ruins this whole point and throws them back to just another pair of drones who succumb to group think.   </p>
<p>Not to say being in a traditional festive spirit is wrong, it&#39;s the creepy Orwellian way in which the neighbours enforce it on our central characters that throws me. It&#39;s threatening and aggressive, and implies that rather than being full of spirit and joy, you should mindlessly be involved in traditions because <em>that&#39;s what people do here</em>.   </p>
<p>Oh, and at the end they randomly imply that a minor character who&#39;s only popped up in a few scenes is actually the real Santa Claus, as his 2CV is pulled in the sky by a herd of reindeer. Sigh. You can&#39;t force Christmas.   </p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ It&#39;s a fairly all-star cast for the time. Jamie Lee Curtis comes on the back of Freaky Friday, Cheech Marin has just done three Spy Kids movies, and Erik Per Sullivan is at the height of playing Dewey in <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>.   </p>
<p>Tim Allen leads and, I must admit, I do like him. I&#39;ve always had the impression people have a certain beef with Allen, but he tends to do a pretty good job at the lovably dim-witted lead. Galaxy Quest, Toy Story, Home Improvements and The Santa Clause (which I watched <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-santa-clause/">last year</a>) are all solid examples of this.   </p>
<p>The supporting cast is pretty strong too, almost all playing stereotypes, but playing them well. One strange exception is Dan Akyroyd, whose character is continuously irritating and not fun (for the reasons in the section above).   </p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ <em>Christmas with the Kranks</em> has such a weird tone! It goes from some childish slapstick of Tim Allen being splashed with a puddle of water to (immediately afterwards) Jamie Lee Curtis prepping herself for getting laid on the dinner table. Weird. And then there&#39;s a whole gag of a priest staring at bikini-clad Curtis&#39;s chest.   </p>
<p>This all cycles back around to the earlier point too: the people involved don&#39;t seem to actually want to celebrate Christmas, they&#39;re being forced to. And not in a way that&#39;s explored at all; they&#39;re completely and unquestionably subservient. This is no way to introduce Christmas to children, to provide an expectation that they&#39;ll enjoy it.   </p>
<p>However, a couple of stars must be left in for slapstick comedy and a few witty bits of dialogue. I can&#39;t be too crushing on day two, after all.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ A load of carols show up in this, both as part of the soundtrack and being sang by a choir. The soundtrack ones play well, doing the absolutely correct job of adding an overtone throughout the movie. There&#39;s also a welcome appearance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2u0BvyDxdM">Holiday on Strings</a>, which I&#39;ve never previously considered a festive piece but probably will from now on.   </p>
<p>As for those aforementioned carol singers, they very aggressively sing at the Kranks whilst surrounding their house which starts as a cheap laugh (the whole cast seem to appear) but quickly falls into the sinister and downright creepy tone that this film rides on for its middle third.   </p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆<br />A promising start, offering a break from the norm, but it quickly falls into a menacing and aggressive plot that proves, no matter how individual you might you are, you should always just conform at your own personal expense.   </p>
<p>&quot;Based on on a book by John Grisham&quot;. It&#39;s not quite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106918/"><em>The Firm</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is one of the many (many!) films that I&#39;ve just never gotten around to watching, despite massive public interest. So when the DVD case said it was &quot;synonymous with Christmas&quot;, I was a little sceptical. Consider me silenced.   </p>
<p><em>Miracle</em> (or, Wikipedia informs me, &quot;The Big Heart&quot; in the UK) follows the story of a man who is convinced he is the real Santa Claus. First spotted for his leading role in the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Kris Kringle (which sounds more like a rapper&#39;s name than St Nick&#39;s) is quickly promoted to the flagship store&#39;s lead Santa. He performs the job admirably, and is noted for giving shoppers advice about items in stores other than Macy&#39;s.   </p>
<p>Almost seventy years later, and boy do we need Kris Kringle back. The whole goodwill story of trying to work around the harsh consumer reality of Christmas is fascinating, and as sought to day as it undoubtedly was when the film debuted. Sure, this is a glaring advert for Macy&#39;s, but it tells a genuinely nice story, as the rest of the cast are slowly whisked up in Kringle&#39;s romantic ideas of how the festive season should be.   </p>
<h2 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Well, Edmund Gwenn plays our potentially-real Santa. And, after much deliberation, I think indeed might be the big man himself. The strength of character and sheer charm in Gwenn&#39;s performance is captivating and, despite the ludicrousy of what&#39;s going on, you can totally imagine being caught up in his spell. Indeed, Gwenn won the 20th Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the part.   </p>
<p>Aside from Father Christmas, the cast is full of amazing New York accents (and probably New Jersey, I haven&#39;t got the ear for it). Broad twangs all, they draw out the hurriedness of the big city, compared to Santa&#39;s slower charms. Despite having a main cast, too, there are lots of minor characters in _Miracle_, who all help add to the larger world it sits in.   </p>
<h2 id="family-fun">Family fun</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ The film is _adorable_, which isn&#39;t a word I use much. It&#39;s full of lovely chuckles and giggles and, even during The Fall, remains big-hearted and upbeat. Despite focussing on children and children&#39;s beliefs of Santa, there&#39;s good humour and entertainment for adults too. And, since we see a family become atomic in the form of neighbour Fred Galley, there have to be bonus points awarded there.   </p>
<p><em>Miracle</em> tackles the question of whether Santa exists in a way <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-santa-clause/">we&#39;ve seen before</a>: adults presuming he doesn&#39;t exist, only to be dumbfounded when they confront him! It&#39;s a bit of a cliché but we can forgive that since, in 1947, it may well not have been.   </p>
<h2 id="jingle-bells">Jingle bells</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ <em>Miracle</em> does, a few times, feature Jingle Bells itself. This is tantamount to cheating in this category. There are other carols too, all put in perfectly nicely. As befitting the era, there isn&#39;t too much else of a soundtrack to speak of. I don&#39;t know much about the history of this aspect of cinema but, in my eyes, soundtracks really became a thing much more recently. As someone who&#39;s a big fan of the modern soundtrack, I do really respect the older way of doing things; in <em>Miracle</em> it comes across excellently: you&#39;re not distracted by additional noise and you&#39;re never left wanting some.   </p>
<p>Other films, even decades later, sometimes feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDDjxa7RsKg&#038;t=2m11s">they&#39;re just missing something</a>.   </p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />What a fantastic start to this year&#39;s film collection! What a lovely film. Why, it makes you want to go out and buy a turkey dinner for everyone!   </p>
<p>The directory <em>really</em> likes zooming in on things. Particularly news headlines.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I watched a series of Christmas films &#8211; from classics to pure trash &#8211; in order to get myself into more of a festive spirit. I had such a good time, in fact, that I&#39;m doing it again this year! All new films, some added twists to keep the process fresh, it should be a fun month! (If you missed it, you can catch up on last year&#39;s films <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/christmas-2013-film-list/">here</a>.)   </p>
<p>As before, the selection of films is going to be far-reaching. We&#39;ll see some classics, but we&#39;ll also go over some of the more left-field flicks out there. This year a horror film will be showing up, whilst the Muppets will be going on a new adventure. We&#39;ll be watching films in black and white, and in 3D.   </p>
<p>If you have any suggestions, please do write them in the comments below, or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/gregtyler">@gregtyler</a>. If I can&#39;t fit them in this year, maybe they&#39;ll make it to the 2015 wishlist!   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ve probably been directed to this page because you would like to look at Path, an application developed at the University of Edinburgh that is only immediately available to members of the University. Fortunately, this page will quickly take you through how to get an &quot;EASE Friend&quot; account to take a look at Path and other University systems yourself.</p>
<p>This is all completely above board and intentional use of the system. This guide only exists because the ability to create such an account isn&#39;t properly advertised.</p>
<h2 id="get-started-with-ease-friend">Get started with EASE Friend</h2>
<p>Short version: Go to <a href="https://www.ease.ed.ac.uk/friend/">https://www.ease.ed.ac.uk/friend/</a> and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Long version: You&#39;ll be asked to enter your email address, which you&#39;ll ultimately use to log in. Do so, agree to the University&#39;s computing regulations and wait for an email to be sent to your inbox. This will link you to a registration form where you&#39;ll need to re-enter the email address and select a password.</p>
<p>You will then be able to use this email address/password to log in to EASE. Once you have done so, you can access Path at the link below:<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently worked on <a href="https://blog.swdev.ed.ac.uk/2014/07/22/a-new-course-timetable-browser/">a project at work</a> to bring course timetables more easily to students through a new <a href="https://browser.ted.is.ed.ac.uk/">course timetable browser</a> website. This got me interested in a few different things to do with University timetables, including how events are distributed through the week. The result of that interest is a new website where you can explore how busy the University&#39;s timetable is under certain conditions.   </p>
<p><strong>Data disclaimer:</strong> The data used in this site is provided by a snapshot at a particular time. It wasn&#39;t 100% reliable at the time I pulled it and it certainly isn&#39;t reliable now. All the statistics here should be seen as indicators, not accurate values.   </p>
<p>If you want to get your hands dirty, you can click the button below to have a play for yourself. But keep reading for a few interesting results I found.   </p>
<p><a href="http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/timetable/">Explore the timetables yourself</a>   </p>
<h2 id="the-global-grid">The global grid</h2>
<p>![The global grid](/tt-default.png &quot;:right The &quot;global grid&quot;&quot;)</p>
<p>The default grid (with no filters applied) already shows some interesting patterns. Firstly we can see that there&#39;s a clear lunch-break in the middle of the day from 1 &#39;til 2. This must have stuck in my mind because still now I normally take my lunch-break in that hour. There&#39;s also a noticeable lack of courses on Wednesday afternoons. This seems to be <a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1720752">common at other universities too</a> and I&#39;ve been under the impression it&#39;s for people engaged in sports. Also, a midweek break is probably good for morale.   </p>
<p>My favourite little caveat about the global grid is the drop in events on Friday afternoons, which I&#39;m sure students will be very happy to acknowledge.   </p>
<h2 id="optional-classes">Optional classes</h2>
<p>At the top of the Options section, you can toggle on and off &quot;optional&quot; classes. These are generally events where students get to pick a class from a selection of slots throughout the week to suit their timetable best. I haven&#39;t included them by default for a couple of reasons:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Under some filters they can quadruple the events.   </li>
<li>Being optional, they&#39;re not designed to balance as well through the week. Some are more haphazard, so don&#39;t reflect the intentional timetabling design.   </li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend playing with them though, it can yield some interesting results.   </p>
<h2 id="specific-schools">Specific schools</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1208" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1208" class="size-full wp-image-1208" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-gesc.png" alt="Geosciences timetable" width="857" height="536" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-gesc.png 857w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-gesc-300x188.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-gesc-768x480.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-gesc-625x391.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1208" class="wp-caption-text">[School of Geosciences](http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/timetable/#filter=school,school=SU849)</p></div><br />
<div id="attachment_1211" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1211" class="size-full wp-image-1211" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-math.png" alt="Mathematics timetable" width="855" height="535" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-math.png 855w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-math-300x188.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-math-768x481.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-math-625x391.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1211" class="wp-caption-text">[School of Mathematics](http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/timetable/#filter=school,school=SU253)</p></div></p>
<hr>
<p>Not all schools follow the global grid as well as others. Whilst the School of Geosciences provides a very good example of sticking to the default, the School of Mathematics bite completely against the curve having busier Friday afternoons than Tuesdays.   </p>
<h2 id="harder-courses-are-more-often-in-the-afternoon">Harder courses are more often in the afternoon</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1209" style="width: 868px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1209" class="size-full wp-image-1209" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-level-10.png" alt="Level 10 timetable" width="858" height="539" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-level-10.png 858w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-level-10-300x188.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-level-10-768x482.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-level-10-625x393.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1209" class="wp-caption-text">[Level 10 courses](http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/timetable/#filter=credit_level,credit_level=10)</p></div><br />

<hr>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s really enough statistical significance to make this claim but I&#39;m going to anyway. Looking at the charts above, you should be able to see that level 10 courses tend to occur more in the morning than the afternoon whilst level 11 courses (which are harder) occur more in the afternoon. I guess this makes sense, as then students will be progressively getting challenged more throughout the day rather than burning out earlier on.   </p>
<h2 id="tutorials-happen-later">Tutorials happen &quot;later&quot;</h2>
<div id="attachment_1212" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1212" class="size-full wp-image-1212" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-tutorials.png" alt="Tutorials timetable" width="857" height="536" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-tutorials.png 857w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-tutorials-300x188.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-tutorials-768x480.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/tt-tutorials-625x391.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1212" class="wp-caption-text">[Tutorials](http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/timetable/#filter=type,type=Tutorial,optional=1)</p></div>
<p>Perhaps the least surprising thing I noticed was that tutorials happen &quot;later&quot;; be that later in the day or later in the week, they tend to be towards the right and bottom edges of the grid (except that impressive outlier on Wednesday mornings). Again, this is totally believable because someone scheduling a class might like to keep it within the week, teaching content at the start and having a tutorial at the end. Of course, this wouldn&#39;t work if <em>every</em> class had that setup, hence the rest of the grid still being fairly full throughout the week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As it has done the past few years, Facebook tried to make a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yearinreview/TheGregTyler">Year in Review</a> for me. There are a couple of reasons this doesn&#39;t work: Facebook&#39;s algorithms are squiffy and I don&#39;t post enough important life events to it (either that or I supremely underestimated the importance of some events). In a retaliation of sorts, I decided to make my own Year in Review which actually makes sense.   </p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>In July, and after struggling mentally to complete fourth year, I graduated from Edinburgh University. Strangely, my degree title was a &quot;Master of Arts in Mathematics&quot;, which is totally possible in Scotland. Months later I would discover that technically I didn&#39;t fulfil the requirements for that title, something I can hopefully prevent from happening in the future at my new job.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1216" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/4th-Year-Jump.jpg" alt="Photo of 4th year students" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/4th-Year-Jump.jpg 2048w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/4th-Year-Jump-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/4th-Year-Jump-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/4th-Year-Jump-625x417.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s been a funny change, not spending every day with those same people. I still see plenty of them, and regularly, but it&#39;s not quite the same. Everyone says you make your best friends at University and so far it looks like that&#39;s pretty true.   </p>
<h2 id="employment">Employment</h2>
<p>A week after graduating, I started work at the University I&#39;d just left. After eighteen years at the sharp end of education, I&#39;ve moved behind the curtain to help make that experience happen for others. I&#39;m working as part of Development Services, making and maintaining the various University web services. In particular, I&#39;ve been continuing to work with <a href="http://path.is.ed.ac.uk/">Path</a>, the course selection application I was previously involved in as a student.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1205" style="width: 1546px" class="wp-caption alignfull"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1205" class="size-full wp-image-1205" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/teviot-place.jpg" alt="Teviot Place, the home of the Edinburgh University Student&#39;s Association" width="1536" height="966" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/teviot-place.jpg 1536w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/teviot-place-300x189.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/teviot-place-768x483.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/teviot-place-625x393.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1205" class="wp-caption-text">Edinburgh University. The actual building I work in isn&#39;t pictured, because it isn&#39;t as pretty.</p></div>
<p>It&#39;s been fun becoming part of the &quot;real world&quot;, and I&#39;ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by very warm, friendly and intelligent people who&#39;ve helped with the transition.   </p>
<p>On the subject of Path, me and Paul got to speak about it at the <a href="http://www.enhancementthemes.ac.uk/events/enhancement-themes-conference">Enhancement Themes</a> conference in Glasgow, which was a fascinating insight into the world of curriculum development in Higher Education. It also made us aware of how exciting Path was, not just for our institution but around the country as well. A lot of the conference went way over our heads, but to be allowed to take part was a great experience.   </p>
<h2 id="websites">Websites</h2>
<p>I released my <a href="http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/">playground</a> this year, which I&#39;m planning to use for one-shot websites and gags. On there already is the <a href="http://play.gregtyler.co.uk/upworthy/">Upworthy Headline Generator</a> which I knocked together in an afternoon and am quite proud of. There&#39;s also <a href="http://gharmony.gregtyler.co.uk/">gHarmony</a>, my <em>very</em> personal dating site which hasn&#39;t had particularly positive results yet.   </p>
<p><a href="http://quizzard.co.uk/">Quizzard</a> has had a really good year. I haven&#39;t been developing it too actively, but it&#39;s now been used for almost 40 quizzes and has over 1500 questions on it. I&#39;ve pushed a few enhancements for editing, and introduced the ability to automatically generate slide shows. I haven&#39;t made any advances to making Quizzard more public, but it&#39;s still somewhere in my mind that I&#39;d like to.   </p>
<p>Now in its third year, <a href="http://talklikeapoirotday.co.uk/">Talk Like a Poirot Day</a> went down well again, reaching thousands of people and doing very well on social networks. Whereas TLAPD used to be something only me and friends published about, this year I was amazed to see people from all over the world with no link to me posting on Facebook and tweeting about the event. We still haven&#39;t caught the eye of any low-stream media sites to my knowledge, which makes this all feel like an underground sect.   </p>
<p><a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/">This very site</a> was launched just before Christmas last year (first blog post 14th December 2012), but only really came into proper use over the past twelve months. I&#39;ve published a real mix of content, from <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/much-ado-about-noetherian-rings/">Shakespearian verse</a> to <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/hellcats/">reviewing TV shows</a>, <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/ssl-read-errno-10054/">technical tips</a> to <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/britains-most-northerly-sheep/">safari in the Shetland islands</a>. I&#39;ve got some plans to redesign the site a bit, and should probably point out again the inspiration I&#39;ve got from <a href="http://www.polygon.com/">Polygon</a>, who continue to show that editorial content can embrace beautiful design.   </p>
<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>
<p>The Pleasance Quiz continues to go strong, pulling in students from all years and a few graduates too. We&#39;ve rearranged the rounds a couple of times in the past year and will probably do so again at some point to keep things fresh. Writing questions was much easier as a student when I had so much free time in the days, but I still find time to write mindless trivia, normally while watching the F1. We lost quizmaster Innes from the quiz in the second half of the year as he had to go on placement as part of his studies, making way for quizmaster Angus &#8211; who hosts the other EUSA quizzes &#8211; to join our stage. He hasn&#39;t done anything too embarrassing yet.   </p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>This is probably the bit of my life that Facebook summed up best, unsurprisingly. As our final year drew a close, all the right effort was made to see everyone as much as possible.   </p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1136" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-social.jpg" alt="Compilation of photos from social events of 2013" width="1400" height="480" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-social.jpg 1400w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-social-300x103.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-social-768x263.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-social-625x214.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" />
<p>Particular kudos go to the Maths Ball, and the many days of summer spent sitting on the Meadows with beer and slack lines. I was also lucky enough to see my friend&#39;s wedding, the first I&#39;d been to. It was a lovely, special day that cemented the fact we&#39;d all become grown-ups.   </p>
<p>Of course there was also the Edinburgh Fringe which, as ever, brought a host of friends back to sleep on our sofas and enjoy some of the best (and, let&#39;s be honest, worst) comedy, theatre and music on offer. My fourth year in the Fringe, this is certainly the one I spent the most money on going to shows, bringing me to the realisation that paid shows are much preferable to the free ones I used to go to.   </p>
<h2 id="going-home">Going Home</h2>
<p>Throughout 2012 I didn&#39;t go home at all, even at Christmas. So it was great to revisit Bristol in November this year. I owe a lot to the city and people there, who really helped mould me into the man I am today. As well as seeing my parents and catching up with the locals (enjoying a few evenings in the pub down the road, of course), the trip centred around two events: a trip to Cardiff and a late Guy Fawkes night planned months in advance.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1179" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179" class="size-full wp-image-1179" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-in-tardis.jpg" alt="Me and my friends inside the set of the TARDIS" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-in-tardis.jpg 960w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-in-tardis-300x225.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-in-tardis-768x576.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/me-in-tardis-625x469.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1179" class="wp-caption-text">Five future time lords</p></div>
<p>The Cardiff trip was mainly to visit <a href="http://www.doctorwhoexperience.com/">The Doctor Who Experience</a> (in stark contrast to all those going visiting for the international rugby that day) with a group of former Young Leaders from my old Scout group. We&#39;re spread all around the country now, so it&#39;s been a few years since we last got the five of us together in one place. It amazes me that, after we&#39;ve all gone off to different Universities in different cities, gone on to different jobs and to lead different lives, we can still all just meet in a room and talk at each other for hours.   </p>
<p>The Doctor Who Experience itself was really good, I highly recommend it. It&#39;s been very well put together and is just as slick as you would expect any BBC production spin-off to be. There is (or perhaps was) the option to look around the set of the TARDIS as well, which I recommend from the point-of-view of a fan of the show and of someone who loves intelligent TV filming.   </p>
<p>The late Guy Fawkes night was spent with an old friend and their family and friends. Messing about with sparklers and &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; is totally under-rated.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1135" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-guy-fawkes.jpg" alt="With friends on Bonfire Night" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-guy-fawkes.jpg 960w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-guy-fawkes-300x225.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-guy-fawkes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/2013-guy-fawkes-625x469.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>2013 was a year of development. Moving away from learning and into working; moving away from many friends; starting to work on websites more formally and completely. I&#39;m not sure what 2014 will involve, and am particularly aware that I may settle further into this city or move to a new one to face new challenges. But I hope I can continue to live the rich social life I&#39;ve grown accustomed to, and go on developing interesting new websites that help and entertain people.</p>

      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 16:53:10 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the month of December up to Christmas, I busied myself watching a selection of festive films. Ranging from the classics (<a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-muppet-christmas-carol/">The Muppet Christmas Carol</a>) to the strange (<a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/holiday-in-handcuffs/">Holiday in Handcuffs</a>), straddling some disappointingly non-Christmassy flicks along the way (<a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/on-her-majestys-secret-service/">On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</a>), I enjoyed the whole experience.   </p>
<p>You can find the full list of films watched, with my star-rating and a link to each review <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/christmas-2013-film-list/">right here</a>.   </p>
<p>After all this joy, I thought it would be suitable to write a follow-up post looking back at some statistics.   </p>
<p>I watched <strong>12 films</strong> with an average length of <strong>1 hour, 38 minutes</strong> which means I watched a total of <strong>19 hours and 39 minutes</strong> of Christmas movies. The longest was <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service_, weighing in at over two hours. The shortest was _The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> which wraps itself up in 1 hour, 28 minutes.   </p>
<p>If I was paid minimum wage to watch each film, I would&#39;ve earned £124 which would buy me <strong>310 litres of milk</strong>, which is enough to fill a couple of bathtubs! I could be <em>bathing</em> in milk.   </p>
<h2 id="notable-mentions">Notable mentions</h2>
<p>There were lots of films I didn&#39;t get to watch, and several I chose not to. Top of the list of recommendations were <em>Die Hard</em> and <em>Love Actually_, two films that I love far too much to fairly review. A few older films were also recommended to me that I didn&#39;t get to watch, including _The Bishop&#39;s Wife</em> and <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em>.   </p>
<p>Lest we forget, too, the weirder films that I didn&#39;t get around to. We had planned to watch <em>Reindeer Games</em> in which Ben Affleck becomes &quot;the unwilling mastermind of a Christmas Eve casino heist&quot;. I&#39;ll definitely be watching that piece of joy sometime soon. I missed _Make the Yuletide Gay_, in which a gay college student has trouble coming out to his parents at Christmas; _Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman_, the horror sequel that never needed to happen, and _Jack Frost (1998)_, where a son reconnects with his dead father who reappears as a snowman and slowly, tragically melts. Frankly, I made efforts to avoid all three.   </p>
<p>Ultimately, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_relating_to_Christmas">a lot of Christmas films</a>. It was hard to pick which ones to watch and the decision was often made from convenience of what people had on DVD. I&#39;m sorry if I missed your favourite film, but maybe I&#39;ll get round to some more next year. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1425922/">Black Nativity</a> is out on DVD now, and to not review that would be sacrilege.   </p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s an interesting grid of some common themes across the movies, and which ones hit the mark:   </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AgpfejSRrTKedGxXN2I1OUlLMXFZN0I1M1NpOTdSWmc&#038;single=true&#038;gid=0&#038;output=html">Interesting grid of common themes</a></strong>   </p>
<p>You&#39;ll notice that, according to this rudimentary system, the most Christmassy film was <em>The Santa Clause_, scoring in all categories. Scoring no points were _Shaft</em> and <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> (which should come as no surprise), but also <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> which is a bit of a shame as it at least tries to be festive.   </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I <em>did</em> enjoy watching all these films, despite my general dislike for Christmas. A lot of them were really nice, caring films that help you to get in that all important festive spirit. I saw quite a few with friends, and it was great to hang out with them, centring an evening around watching a movie and using this blog as an excuse to chill.   </p>
<p>Picking a favourite film from the selection would be like picking a favourite child, and mine would be <em>The Santa Clause</em>. It embodies the Christmas spirit, and manages to keep its humour whilst focussed around serious issues of divorce and broken families. My least favourite was <em>Home Alone: The Holiday Heist</em> whose only redeeming feature was the appearance of Malcolm McDowell.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>James Bond continues his search for Blofeld after their tête-à-tête in Japan. At one point, he spends some time in Blofeld&#39;s company over the Christmas period.</em>   </p>
<p>Let&#39;s not beat around the bush here. I&#39;ve watched a lot of Christmas films recently and fancied something a bit different. Having realised some of OHMSS takes place on Christmas Eve, I thought I might as well cash-in on it.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The most festive person in this film is Ernst Stavro Blofeld (now The Count de Bleuchamp) who, like some under-dressed evil-minded Santa, provides the only gifts we see exchanged over Christmas. Admittedly these gifts are biological agents that will be used to destroy England&#39;s agricultural yield for the year, but they are presents nonetheless.   </p>
<p>Points also go to Switzerland, as Bond attends the Christmas Eve celebrations in a small Swiss town where there&#39;s singing, dancing and ice skating in full force. Swiss Christmas looks idyllic, as people run about laughing and being merry. It&#39;s certainly a damn site better than the celebrations in Piz Gloria as one imagines Blofeld sitting around with a small cup of eggnog making awkward smalltalk with the assembled ex-cons he employs as ski instructors.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ George Lazenby dons Bond&#39;s boots for this outing, filling the incredible void left by Sean Connery after five films at the helm. Deeply desiring the role, Lazenby bought himself a Rolex and Saville Row suit to fit the character, and even went to Connery&#39;s barber. All of this paid off, and he was offered a seven-film deal which, perhaps for the best, he turned down.   </p>
<p>Joining Lazenby were the gorgeous Diana Rigg as Tessa (this is become less of a Christmas review by the second), the wonderfully-bald Telly Savalas as Blofeld, and the amiable Gabriele Ferzetti as Marc-Ange Draco &#8211; one of my favourite Bond characters. Then of course there are the Bond stalwarts filling the ranks back at MI6 as M, Q and Moneypenny all return to the fold unsurprised by Bond&#39;s rather rapid apparent facial surgery.   </p>
<p>OHMSS is memorable, perhaps unfairly, for its large array of &quot;Bond girls&quot; in Blofeld&#39;s Swiss clinic, all suffering from unusual allergies and all from extremely disparate parts of the world. Undercover as the heraldry expert Sir Hilary Bray, Bond has to pretend to not be particularly interested in courting women but &#8211; despite his upcoming marriage &#8211; promptly becomes a two-a-night sort of chap.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1185" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1185" class="size-full wp-image-1185" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ohmss-031.jpg" alt="The cast of On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ohmss-031.jpg 1280w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ohmss-031-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ohmss-031-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/ohmss-031-625x352.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1185" class="wp-caption-text">Sir Hilary Bray and his new allergy-ridden friends.</p></div>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ I watched this with my Dad and we had a great time! But honesty is due. Some of the death scenes are a bit brutal (someone goes into a snow-churning machine, another falls a very long way off a cliff, which we witness all of). There&#39;s also a healthy smattering of misogyny and domestic abuse, though Marc-Ange&#39;s witticism about sparing the rod does overshadow one of them. Honestly, I think the amount of fun your family will have with this film rather depends on the sort of family you&#39;re in.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Whilst not at all Christmassy, the music in OHMSS is of the high standard that we&#39;ve grown accustomed to in the Bond universe. John Barry returns again to give us an amazing combination of the classic Bond motifs and traditional movie soundtrack mixed sublimely with the chosen Bond theme: this time Louis Armstrong&#39;s &quot;We Have All The Time In The World&quot;. Armstrong&#39;s performance doesn&#39;t make for the title theme, replaced by a more action-packed version of the classic 007 theme, but its integrity in the rest of the soundtrack shows once again how good Barry is at his job.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br />As a Bond aficionado, reviewing Bond films is just wasted time. I recommend you watch OHMSS, just as I recommend you watch all the other Bond films. Whilst perhaps not one of the absolute bests, <em>On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service</em> is a fairly strong film with great characters, some fantastic chases and (amongst the trashy green screen) some really well-shot sequences.   </p>
<p>That&#39;s it! The festive films are over! Have a fantastic Christmas everyone.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>After ruining everybody&#39;s Christmas, Billy Jackson is forced to relive the magical day until he turns himself around in some sort of creepy reimagining of the famous Wizzard song.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ The Christmas spirit on display here is that of small-town America: where the neighbours all know each other, and the community gets together to watch its members tell the nativity story, as they do every year. It&#39;s sweet, but Billy Jackson&#39;s having none of it.   </p>
<p>As you might expect, Billy learns to change his ways. However, he&#39;s initially driven much more by a desire to get out of the infernal loop than to actually spread good-will unto all men. His final day and escaping comes, I think, out of that desire, with the good deeds a fortunate by-product. In the end, he&#39;s a changed man, but perhaps not for the right reasons.   </p>

<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The acting in this isn&#39;t exemplary. The main kid fulfils his role reasonably, but perhaps just because an angsty teen doesn&#39;t have to stretch too far to portray an angsty teen. A nice surprise for me was seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001332/">Robert Hays</a> in a production over than <em>Airplane!</em> which, until now, was my only knowledge of his work.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Again, this film pushes a bit too hard into being anti-Christmas. Billy&#39;s uncle, aunt and cousins come over, and there&#39;s quite some tension there, as there is with his school bully. Whilst these are overcome, because of the repetitive nature of these living-the-same-day-over-and-over films, we are reintroduced to the situation every fifteen minutes or so and reminded of just <em>why</em> Billy wants to get back at the bully. That tension takes it down in the family fun rankings.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Fair enough work put in here: there are some carol singers who show up occasionally and there&#39;s the singing at the nativity pageant, as well as a rollicking song around the piano! All good stuff. The only caveat here is that, again due to the film&#39;s nature, you hear the same songs over and over again. But then, that&#39;s fairly in keeping with the Christmas spirit. Indeed, it&#39;s now Wizzard&#39;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot; that we <em>do</em> hear everyday, and this review neatly wraps itself up, like some sort of prepared Christmas present.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I think these sort of repeating-a-day films should be really easy to write. <em>Groundhog Day</em> is top of the class, pushing out a bit and doing something interesting with it. <em>Christmas Every Day</em> is near the other end of the spectrum: it&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s just quite plain. As Billy discovers problems, you can be guaranteed he&#39;ll fix them by the end of the film, and there are no surprises along the way. It&#39;s fine for a bit of Christmas escapism though.   </p>
<p>Last week, Richard Herring wrote <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/20/richard-herring-ponders-what-life-would-be-like-if-roy-wood-got-his-wish-and-it-really-was-christmas-every-day-4236927/">an article in the Metro</a> asking what it would be like if Christmas <em>did</em> occur every day.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The all-time classic tale of Ebenezer Scrooge, told in song by a cast led by Kelsey Grammer.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ As I said in <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/the-muppet-christmas-carol/">my review for The Muppet Christmas Carol</a>, playing the plot from A Christmas Carol is almost cheating. It is the seminal festive story, grandly explaining the joy and celebration of Christmas, and challenging those not in the spirit. It needs not trashy TV, commercialisation and big red Santas, but instead extols the virtues of spending a day away from work, with your family, and searching for joy in all you can. This is <em>the</em> Christmas story.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p><em>(We open in an executive boardroom, circa 2003.)</em><br />
<strong>Executive 1:</strong> So we&#39;re going with the musical Christmas Carol. Who&#39;s going to play Scrooge?<br />
<strong>Executive 2:</strong> There&#39;s no-one left! The Muppets took Michael Caine, the perfect Ebenezer, and we&#39;ve been struggling for someone suitable ever since.<br />
<strong>Executive 3:</strong> We&#39;ve missed out on Tim Curry and Patrick Stewart too.<br />
<em>(The room breathes a collective sigh of worry. There&#39;s a long pause.)</em><br />
<strong>Executive 2:</strong> What about Kelsey Grammer? He&#39;d be fantastic! That voice! &quot;You boy! What day is it?&quot;<br />
<em>(The executives all nod in agreement.)</em><br />
<strong>Executive 1:</strong> Can he sing though? This is a musical after all?<br />
<strong>Executive 2:</strong> Of course he can! It&#39;s Christmas!<br />
<em>(The executives jump in the air, cheering, and break into a rendition of &quot;It&#39;s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year&quot;. Exeunt, pursued by a bear, who is also singing.)</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been putting off watching <em>A Christmas Carol: The Musical</em> for a while, because I&#39;ve been scared. Scared that Kelsey Grammer, an actor I have deep respect for, would fall flat in a singing, dancing, camp-as-you-like-it rendition of what should be a gritty tale. Played straight, I know Grammer could be an incredible Scrooge, but I was terrified his talent would be lost in a loose sing-song version.   </p>
<p>I was wrong.   </p>
<p>As with the original story, current-day Scrooge leads us through the tale but doesn&#39;t act as the central character himself. His realisation provides us with windows into other stories: his upbringing and development, and the tale of the Cratchit&#39;s. Through this, it is not left for Grammer to lead the singing, but to weigh in as-and-when. As a story-teller he does not disappoint, as a singer he equally holds his mark.   </p>
<p>There are fabulous performances elsewhere, including all three Ghosts, and an excellent show from the unknown Steven Miller as young Scrooge. Mr Fezziwig is portrayed as well as I&#39;ve seen him, a cheery happy character full of life and joie de vivre.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1217" style="width: 1025px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1217" class="size-full wp-image-1217" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/acctm-jane-and-kelsey.png" alt="Jane Krakowski and Kelsey Grammer" width="1015" height="768" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/acctm-jane-and-kelsey.png 1015w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/acctm-jane-and-kelsey-300x227.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/acctm-jane-and-kelsey-768x581.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/acctm-jane-and-kelsey-625x473.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1217" class="wp-caption-text">Kelsey Grammer stars, with Jane Krakowski appearing as the Ghost of ~~Drunken Eyes~~ Christmas Past.</p></div>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ As a film that shows the development of happiness in old Ebenezer, this is great for so many people. However, the treatment of the Ghost of Christmas Future is very dark (as perhaps it should be), showing the ransacking of Scrooge&#39;s grave as his former colleagues laugh at how unpopular he is. It&#39;s the fall before the rise, but be warned that it&#39;s pretty deep.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I&#39;m not really a musical kind of guy (despite my unfettered love for <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/pitch-perfect/">Pitch Perfect</a>), but <em>ACCTM</em> is done well. The songs are cheery, but reasonable. They tell stories, but don&#39;t have heavy narrative. There are no &quot;Christmas classics&quot; in it like Jingle Bells, or Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, and that&#39;s completely for the best. The film&#39;s music exists in its own, entirely suitable world.   </p>
<p>I found it hard not to rate this film against <em>Les Miserables_, which is hugely unfair. However, whilst the lip-syncing is sometimes completely off, there is some genuine merit to some of the singing in _ACCTM</em>. In particular, a three-way harmony between Scrooges old and young and Jennifer Love Hewitt is memorable as a solidly delivered piece.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br />For this series I&#39;ve had to get to the films I watch in various ways. Some I owned, some were borrowed from friends, some I had to buy, some I found (<em>ahem</em>) online; <em>A Christmas Carol: The Musical</em> was one I ordered from Amazon. The biggest thing I can take away from this is that I&#39;m glad I bought it, because it means I can watch it again next year. And I will watch it again next year because, unlike some of the other films I&#39;ve looked at, this is exactly what I want to see in a Christmas movie: the passion and spirit of the winter festival wrapped up neatly and delivered well.   </p>
<p>Next Christmas, let&#39;s all watch this one together.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>After Santa takes a tumble from Scott Calvin&#39;s house, it falls upon our luckless hero to fill his boots (and trousers, and shirt).</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I was given a VHS of <em>The Santa Clause</em> when I was a kid and, simply because it was the only Christmas film in the house, it became a bit of a tradition to watch it in December. As I grew up I stopped bothering, but I continue to think of this as a seminal Christmas film.   </p>
<p>Ultimately it really is very, very festive. It&#39;s really happy and, despite approaching some touchy subjects, retains a lovely sense of humour. Even at the start, as the scene is set that Scott&#39;s relationship with his son is a mess, there are adorable jokes. It&#39;s this consistency that makes the film so suitable: it doesn&#39;t lose itself, even when being poignant.   </p>
<p>From a flatter point of view: there&#39;s snow, elves, presents, happy families, carols, the whole business. I find it interesting that <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/jingle-all-the-way/">Jingle All The Way</a> has pretty much the same plot, but with a lot of the Christmas taken out.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ There must have been some Hollywood executive who, on paper, thought the casting of Tim Allen as Santa was going to be a greatly regrettable mistake. However, he really pulls off the role. Of course, as with any Tim Allen work these days, it&#39;s hard not to hear Buzz Lightyear delivering the lines but, when this first came around in &#39;94 he would&#39;ve been known as the voice of Tim Taylor from Home Improvement. He&#39;s great though. His best work beyond <em>Toy Story 3</em>.   </p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s talk elves. They&#39;re all played by children and some are really great. First up is Bernard, played by David Krumholtz. You may know David from Numb3rs, or 10 Things I Hate About You, or Serenity, or Superbad, or Harold &amp; Kumar. But you wouldn&#39;t have known this 15 year-old Krumholtz as <em>The Santa Clause</em> in some ways marks the start of his career. Then honourable mentions to Judy (Bernard&#39;s second), Quintin (A lovely homage to the Bond franchise&#39;s Q) and the leader of E.L.F.S (the rather shoe-horned acronym for Elite Liberating Flight Squad). None of them have gone on to much since, but perhaps it&#39;s best that we remember them for the great roles they played in this classic!   </p>
<div id="attachment_1206" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1206" class="size-full wp-image-1206" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/the-santa-clause-poster.jpg" alt="Poster for The Santa Clause" width="780" height="439" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/the-santa-clause-poster.jpg 780w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/the-santa-clause-poster-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/the-santa-clause-poster-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/the-santa-clause-poster-625x352.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1206" class="wp-caption-text">Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) and his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd); pre-transformation.</p></div>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ <em>The Santa Clause</em> tackles some very serious family issues, as the characters are based around an unhappy divorce which leads to a dispute over visitation rights. It holds together, though, because all the arguing is done in a very light-hearted accessible manner, punctuated by fantastic one-liners from Scott Calvin.   </p>
<p>I watched this with a group of pals and we all sided with Scott who, despite being grumpy, was very witty and cutting. He also gets a little poignant speech explaining what family values mean to him, which is adorable. It amuses me though, that Wikipedia&#39;s editors don&#39;t agree. The lead is dryly described as &quot;a cynical, ordinary man who becomes Santa Claus over the course of 11 months&quot; whilst his wife&#39;s annoying, boring new partner gets the rather kind &quot;a gentle, well-meaning, yet critical psychiatrist&quot;.   </p>
<p>As a kid, I wanted to be the Charlie (the son). As I grow up, I want to be more like Scott. He&#39;s a bit grumpy, a bit mad, but as soon as he sees what Santa means to people, he commits 100% to the role. If I&#39;m ever put in that situation, I only hope I can be as keen.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Plenty of good Christmas songs in here, including some choral work, solo pieces and even that one time Alvin and the Chipmunks covered &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#39; to Town&quot;. Ultimately, a very suitable selection.   </p>
<p>If the music is too much for you in the festive season, there are still a few fantastic musical cues: Scott eating piles of food to the Jeopardy theme tune, a heartbeat playing Jingle Bells, and a slow-motion walk by the elves to ZZ Top&#39;s &quot;Give Me All Your Lovin&#39;&quot;.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br />Before this evening, I couldn&#39;t work out if this film was any good or just fond memories; I now conclude that, yes, this film is rather excellent. I grinned the whole way through, and laughed for most of it too. We had a room of people of different senses of humour, nationalities and backgrounds, some who&#39;d seen the film before, and some who hadn&#39;t. We unanimously concluded that this was the Christmas classic we all wanted to see.   </p>
<p>There was a bit of a division over what we thought of the CGI in <em>The Santa Clause</em>. I think the issue is that the film tries to overstep the mark a bit for the era. This was the same year as <em>The Lion King_, but also as _Speed</em>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch proves to us that the Stockholm Syndrome works! Clearly a great festive moral message.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ This could have be played out with at least some modicum of Christmas joy if Trudie at least seemed to want to enjoy her Christmas. Instead, she seems to be there out of obligation and the general plot (that she kidnaps a customer at her café) is driven purely from a desire to appease her otherwise distant family.   </p>
<p>Ultimately, it feels like Christmas fits around <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> purely because: a) it&#39;s a convenient reason plot-wise for Trudie to have to see her family b) seasonal films often make bare money on DVD releases.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ So Melissa Joan Hart was the live-action Sabrina The Teenage Witch for 7 years, but I still didn&#39;t recognise her at all and only learnt this fact after looking up the film on IMDb. Meanwhile, Mario Lopez (who plays our unfortunate kidnapee) is very familiar, and I have no idea why. No-one&#39;s particularly good in this though.   </p>
<p>That all said, fair shoutout to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001478/">June Lockhart</a> who plays &quot;Grandma&quot; and has a nice comic moment when the police finally arrive to finish this dreary toss, as she shouts &quot;I don&#39;t know who brought in the bacon, but I&#39;m going to fry it up in a pan&quot; whilst brandishing an ancient firearm. It&#39;s a rare piece of entertainment in a mire of lameness.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1166" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1166" class="size-full wp-image-1166" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/holiday-in-handcuffs-painting.jpg" alt="A painting from the film" width="640" height="503" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/holiday-in-handcuffs-painting.jpg 640w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/holiday-in-handcuffs-painting-300x236.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/holiday-in-handcuffs-painting-625x491.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1166" class="wp-caption-text">This painting, drawn up by the main character, was quite good.</p></div>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ I wouldn&#39;t wish this on anyone&#39;s kindred, not least because it is based around a tremendously broken family.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ No effort made.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆<br />This fits into that sub-genre of nonsense-y trashy films that I sometimes quite like, but <em>Holiday in Handcuffs</em> doesn&#39;t cut the mustard. It&#39;s just really rather poor. Maybe, if I&#39;d had a few glasses of mulled wine and watched it with a few friends, I could have found the funny side; but it just didn&#39;t gel for me.   </p>
<p>If you strangely desire to watch _Holiday in Handcuffs_, you can find it &#8211; with international subtitles &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmu3UCtyI6A">on YouTube</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If you&#39;ve somehow never seen The Muppet Christmas Carol, its title tells you literally everything you need to know.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I equate this to cheating. Using Dickens&#39; classic novella as your Christmas plot is like using puppies to sell dog food: there&#39;s no way to fail. A Christmas Carol is not only <em>the</em> Christmas story, it also features three card-carrying spirits! Hence this category is won in two ways.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ It&#39;s the ruddy Muppets, so it is of course a charming masterpiece, performed beautifully by the best puppeteers the world has to offer. On top of this adorableness, they cast Michael Caine as Scrooge and <em>TMCC</em> is sealed as having one of the best Christmas cast lists ever. Indeed, not only are the puppets played majestically, but Caine falls right into the spirit of Scrooge perfectly and bounces off his compatriots like an absolute champ.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Again, it&#39;s the Muppets! I struggle to think of a more family-friendly troupe. Five stars, no questions asked.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There&#39;s some lovely musical numbers in this, and even Mr Caine <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpb9EbmvM5M">joins in</a> himself (he&#39;s not bad too)! That said, there could certainly be <em>more</em> music in this film, as I&#39;m sure Kelsey Grammer will prove soon, so I docked it a star. Beyond that perfectly feasible reason, I&#39;m loathe to score anything as 20/20 because then I might as well give up on this series.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br /><em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> was clearly released knowing in advance what my Christmas movie criteria would be, and has cheated its way into being the first five-star rated film of the season. However, this film does oft wrestle for the throne Best Christmas Movie, so credit where credit&#39;s due I suppose.   </p>
<p>Having a favourite Muppet would be disgraceful; like having a favourite child. Mine is Dr Bunsen Honeydew.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We also see Christian Bale as a racist rich white kid who gets himself on the wrong side of Shaft, and is handsomely rewarded with punches to the face. Bale&#39;s performance is solid, but overshadowed by the fact that his character&#39;s main development happens when he&#39;s granted bale (gettit?) from a crime he almost certainly did commit.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Ha ha ha! Seriously? It opens with a race crime! Not suitable for kids, parents, grandparents, white people, or those with an aversion to swearing.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ Whilst the music isn&#39;t at all Christmassy, it is <em>fantastic</em>. If you haven&#39;t heard <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEaRCAcfOEQ">Shaft&#39;s theme</a> then you&#39;ve been missing out, and the rest of the film continues in a similar 80s cop vibe. It&#39;s a marvellous soundtrack which, while not very Christmassy, deserves a few points here for the sheer goddamn quality of it.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆<br /><em>Shaft</em> is by no means a Christmas film. The music, the plot, the atmosphere; it&#39;s all fantastic, but distinctively not festive. I enjoyed this movie, but including it in the Christmas season was a foolhardy movie.   </p>

<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ <em>Elf</em> is &#8211; as I see it &#8211; primarily a fish-out-of-water comedy, and it&#39;s rather good at that role as we see Buddy run havoc around New York City, getting hit by every taxi cab in sight. That mood takes up the middle section of the film, whilst the beginning and end really settle into the Christmas spirit. Mid-range points for this category, as I thought more could&#39;ve been made of the festive themes during the centre third.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Will Ferrell shines in this film, as you&#39;d probably imagine. I&#39;m often amazed at Ferrell&#39;s ability to play such over-the-top characters but not feel like he&#39;s doing the same role every time. The rest of the cast generally all fit well too, with a particular mention due to Peter Dinklage as an easily wound-up children&#39;s book connoisseur.   </p>
<p>Of course, with Jon Favreau directing, it features Jon Favreau playing an uncomplicated but perfectly passable role.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ I know others don&#39;t agree with me on this, but <em>Elf</em> didn&#39;t give me that tingly family feel. Ultimately, I&#39;m not sure how much the youngest of kids would enjoy it, and it doesn&#39;t strike me as the sort of film my mum would put up with just because the children wanted to watch it. It&#39;s perfectly nice though, and accessible for plenty of ages; just doesn&#39;t quite bite my criteria of wholesome family goodness.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ The soundtrack is perfectly nice, and it ends with a pretty solid Christmas carol. However, it doesn&#39;t give these the sort of attention required by this entirely arbitrary category.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br /><em>Elf</em> is a fun, silly film with a mostly enjoyable plot. Ferrell is excellent, as are other cast members; the cinematography is impressive and even the stunt work has had just the right treatment. Ultimately, the seasonal criteria rating perhaps don&#39;t do this comedy film justice, but that&#39;s just about what you expect when the guy behind <em>Iron Man</em> and <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em> makes a Christmas film, right?   </p>
<div id="attachment_1155" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1155" class="size-full wp-image-1155" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/elf-dirk-lawson.jpg" alt="Dirk Lawson from Elf" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/elf-dirk-lawson.jpg 1024w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/elf-dirk-lawson-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/elf-dirk-lawson-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/elf-dirk-lawson-625x352.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1155" class="wp-caption-text">Must be another Dirk Lawson…</p></div>
<p>The camera work with Will Ferrell and the elves is really well done. Colour me impressed, Greg Gardiner.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Some lucky few children travel to the North Pole on Christmas Eve to meet Santa and discover the meaning of Christmas.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Amazing. <em>Polar Express</em> really embodies the spirit but doesn&#39;t hang on to the horrible clichés others seem to think it necessary to use. At no point do you lose the Christmas vibe, even in scenes that really aren&#39;t playing it out, because it&#39;s so well ingrained in the plot.   </p>
<p>I think the real difference is that <em>Polar Express</em> is tasteful in its Christmas display. Instead of big bawdy, over-the-top shows, it relaxes to a pleasant and soft atmosphere. The art style certainly helps, but at no point do you feel like the festive season is being rammed down your throat, which is important to me.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Tom Hanks plays several of the main characters, which I have absolutely no problem with, as he fulfils each one perfectly. However, the word &quot;plays&quot; is odd in this context, as <em>Polar Express</em> is done as high-detailed motion capture, often completely separating the acting and voice work. At first, I found the mo-cap really weird, as it&#39;s a half-way mark between animation and physical acting; but as time goes on, the style really comes into its own. Everything has enough realism to feel human, and not look entirely computer-generated, but it still has the ability to add those moments of magic, where incredible scenes can occur seamlessly with very human shots.   </p>
<p>I appreciate the art style <a href="http://fourfour.typepad.com/fourfour/2005/12/the_nightmare_b.html">isn&#39;t for everyone</a>, but since this is <em>my</em> review, I&#39;m gonna darn-well give this category four stars.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ I would happily watch it again, and would recommend it whole-heartedly to all ages. <em>Polar Express</em> definitely crosses the distinction between &quot;children&#39;s film&quot; and &quot;family film&quot;: whilst it&#39;s centred around children and their Christmas values, it really does make a huge effort to be totally accessible to everyone.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ There are some requisite carols here and there, as well as a few other Christmas songs, but generally it&#39;s based in cinematic orchestral soundtrack. However, there are certain overtones of Christmas somehow smuggled into the OST that help it keep the spirit mentioned above. There&#39;s also a bit with an elf designed to look like Steven Tyler from Aerosmith singing away, which isn&#39;t necessarily Christmassy but made for an interesting double-take.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />I really liked Polar Express. It was very sweet, very good fun and had a nice, progressive plot. I personally really liked the art style, and the performances from everyone involved. It was a really engrossing, and quite different, film.   </p>
<p>Just when the film ends, and you think it&#39;s spent all it&#39;s got, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ19mW-TMRk">Josh Groban rocks up for the credits</a>. Wonderful.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Stop it. Please, for the love of God, don&#39;t make any more Home Alone films.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Finn Baxter, our latest child hero, is left alone because he&#39;d rather play a video game that go with his parents to an office Christmas party. His horrible obsession with this game forms the _entire plot of the film_, at one point using a search for controller batteries to lead him to a secret room. Meanwhile, at the party, all the waitresses are young girls dressed in short red dresses and red-and-white-striped stockings. These antitheses of Christmas spirit could be used to poke fun at the modern world, but instead they&#39;re just played straight and it&#39;s really weird.   </p>
<p>There is a heartfelt moment when Finn talks to a college student he&#39;s playing his video game with and finds out the guy is going to spend Christmas alone. Finn seems horrified for a short while and offers to keep the guy company, which is quite sweet, but then he gets caught up on ghosts again.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<div id="attachment_1141" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1141" class="size-full wp-image-1141" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bill-turnbull.jpg" alt="Bill Turnbull from BBC Breakfast" width="630" height="891" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bill-turnbull.jpg 630w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bill-turnbull-212x300.jpg 212w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bill-turnbull-625x884.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1141" class="wp-caption-text">No, BBC Breakfast fans, not _that_ Bill Turnbull.</p></div>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Not Macaulay Culkin, that&#39;s for sure! (Though he <em>is</em> 33 now, so that would be a very different movie.) Indeed, also no Joe Pesci and no Daniel Stern. 22 years after the first Home Alone, <em>Holiday Heist</em> shares little with the original, save name and concept.   </p>
<p>However, getting a star in this category is Malcolm McDowell, taking the role of criminal boss. McDowell, who deserves to be in much, much better content than this, does a great job of being an affable thief and generally delivers his lines wonderfully. Incidentally, if you never watched _Heroes_, he excels as Linderman (another criminal mastermind).   </p>
<p>Another honourable mention is due to Bill Turnbull, who plays Finn&#39;s video gaming college friend and got the only two laughs of the film. We like him.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ Eurgh. Whilst I wouldn&#39;t recommend the damn thing to anyone, I guess it should score some points in the family fun category. Like the previous films, the slapstick comedy is pretty family friendly and harmless (in a manner of speaking). And, again as before, the criminals are extremely non-threatening, useless goons. But if that&#39;s the sort of family fun you&#39;re looking for, just watch the original.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ There are some carol singers ( 1) and McFly&#39;s cover of Deck the Halls (-1). Yeah, don&#39;t bother watching this for the music.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆<br /><em><em>Cries</em></em><br /><img class="size-full wp-image-1167" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/home-alone-me.jpg" alt="Me reenacting the scream face from Home Alone" width="640" height="311" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/home-alone-me.jpg 640w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/home-alone-me-300x146.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/home-alone-me-625x304.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Finn Baxter&#39;s page on the <a href="http://homealone.wikia.com/wiki/Finn_Baxter">Home Alone Wiki</a> has a section labelled &quot;Personality&quot; which is just blank. That is incredibly accurate.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Against all the odds, Martin Freeman puts on a school nativity play with his crazy teaching assistant.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ &quot;And that&#39;s when I decided: I hated Christmas.&quot; states Martin Freeman in the film&#39;s cold opening. In my book, a lack of Christmas spirit is just as good as plentiful amounts of it: it allows us to believe the character can change, can grow to love Christmas, and it&#39;s very hard to do that without injecting them with Christmas charm!   </p>
<p>Sadly, some of the Christmas spirit <em>Nativity!</em> has is somewhat spoiled by the fact that it looks like it was shot in a damp British autumn, not a winter wonderland. Of course, being the UK, it could have equally been a fairly mild winter. Ultimately, some fake snow wouldn&#39;t have gone amiss.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<div id="attachment_1181" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1181" class="size-full wp-image-1181" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/nativity1.jpg" alt="Cast of Nativity, mouths agape" width="400" height="267" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/nativity1.jpg 400w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/nativity1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1181" class="wp-caption-text">They all just found out they&#39;re going to meet Ricky Tomlinson!</p></div>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ A pretty stellar British cast list, as you might expect from BBC films, pitting Martin Freeman against the wonderful villain Jason Watkins portrays. But the devil is in the details, as Ricky Tomlinson plays mayor, Alan Carr is a suitably bitchy critic and other familiar UK faces pop in for a few lines.   </p>
<p>However, it&#39;s the children who really make the film. A fantastic ensemble, they get all the best jokes and seem to love singing and dancing around the school. Despite the size of the class, many students come into their own with lovely back-stories and silly characters.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ It&#39;s about a school nativity play, so unsurprisingly everyone in the family can enjoy it. There are a couple of fart jokes for the kids, and adorable children to bring ear-to-ear grins to adults&#39; faces.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Again, the subject matter of the film gives a slight advantage here. It&#39;s full of songs about the story of the nativity, a lot of them written exclusively. Whilst you could complain it lacks the &quot;classics&quot;, there&#39;s no denying that children singing about how Mary and Joseph fell in love is pretty darn seasonal!   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br /><em>Nativity!</em> will bring joy to your heart and a tear to your eye, just as you might expect. It&#39;s also very funny, so has the honourable pleasure of making me cry both with laughter and emotions. I hadn&#39;t heard of this film before, and it was recommended to me by someone at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pleasancepubquiz">the quiz</a>. Now I recommend it to all of you, because it&#39;s really wonderful.   </p>
<p>The word &quot;adorable&quot; just doesn&#39;t go this film justice.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Arnold Schwarzenegger teaches his son the true meaning of Christmas by ignoring him and instead hanging out with washed-up comedian Sinbad.</em>   </p>
<h3 id="christmas-spirit">Christmas spirit</h3>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ There are some sincere Christmas feels in this, with big parades and creepy Santas, but ultimately it extols the Christmas values we shouldn&#39;t be proud of: The crass commercialisation of the Winterval, the breakdown of core family values, and the creepiness of dudes dressed as Santa in shopping centres. Ultimately, the whole film is about a man trying to win back his son&#39;s love by buying him toys, which is potentially the worst Christmas vice.   </p>
<h3 id="ho-ho-who-s-in-it-">Ho-ho-who&#39;s in it?</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ If Arnie wasn&#39;t enough for you (and he should be), this film also promises the talents of Sinbad, the kid who played young Anakin Skywalker, and the voice of Troy McClure. They all perform exactly as well as you would expect.   </p>
<h3 id="family-fun">Family fun</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There&#39;s something for everyone! Cool characters, fun slapstick action, and a few jokes that should go way over kid&#39;s heads. But Ted, the creepy neighbour, goes a bit too far with his obnoxious advances.   </p>
<h3 id="jingle-bells">Jingle Bells</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ There are some fantastic musical cues in JATW, and it reels out some Christmas favourites, but as time goes on the soundtrack seems to forget itself and falls back on fairly standard action movie orchestral themes. Not top marks in class, but some rousing seasonal tunes do elate your spirits a chunk.   </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆<br />Oh, it&#39;s pretty good. It really is. Certainly Arnie&#39;s best film of 1996 (though not of the decade). I recommend this for fans of fun, silly films. Particularly of fun, silly Arnold Schwarzenegger films.   </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t seen <em>that much</em> Sinbad, but I feel pretty confident in saying this is his best work.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are so many Christmas films. So, so many. From the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406649/">musical version of A Christmas Carol</a> starring Kelsey Grammer to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2308733/">Home Alone 5</a>, by God do we like cashing in on the festive spirit. Sky Movies even have <a href="http://skymovies.sky.com/sky-movies-christmas">a TV channel</a> dedicated to the damn things.   </p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve often quite publicly voiced my opinions about Christmas. In case you don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a touch of the Ebenezer about me. However, I do love films. And my love for films will outweigh my displeasure over Christmas any day. So this Christmas, I want to get into the Christmas spirit by watching some of the best (and worst) Christmas movies.   </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to rate each movie on its Christmas spirit, its cast list, how suitable it is for the family, and the quality of the Christmas music used throughout.   </p>
<p>Below is the list of films I&#39;ve watched so far, plus a link to their writeups. Please do suggest any more in the comments or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/gregtyler">@gregtyler</a>.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#39;ve been getting a lot of people posting links to <a href="https://www.upworthy.com/">Upworthy</a> articles on Facebook. I realised their headlines often followed a similar style so decided to make a little application to generate them.   </p>
<p>You can check out the generator at the link below:   </p>

<h2 id="technical-stuff">Technical stuff</h2>
<p>A quick technical note: The code that pulls out random terms is weighted in this (which is why some people and events show up more or less regularly than others). To do this, every term is an object with a label and a weight. I take the sum of all the weights then generate a random number, <code>rand</code>, between 0 and that. The code then iterates through the array of objects and subtracts the weight of each one from the <code>rand</code>. When <code>rand</code> falls below 0, we&#39;re at the object we want.   </p>
<p>I actually had the code for this sitting around already for another project I&#39;m working on, which was timely.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is just a quick post to note an error I came across today that I couldn&#39;t find any decent help with it. I was using cURL in PHP to connect via HTTPS to a web service, and came across the following error:   </p>
<pre><code>SSL read: error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0), errno 10054</code></pre>
<p>It looks like it might be an error with OpenSSL, or with the server I was hitting, but it turned out to just be a rogue space.   </p>
<p>I was generating a URL with a GET parameter (gregtyler.co.uk?getparam=somevalue), but it had generated with a space in the value. Now a web browser would turn that into a &quot; &quot; or plus symbol but cURL, for whatever reason, didn&#39;t.   </p>
<p>So if you&#39;ve come across this problem (and I&#39;m putting this here with the hope that it&#39;ll be crawled for future people stuck), check to see if there&#39;s any whitespace in your URL and urlencode it.   </p>
<p>All in all, a silly mistake on my behalf that caused far more trouble than it should have. Hopefully you won&#39;t be stuck the same way now!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People often ask me* &quot;Greg, what music are you listening to at the moment?&quot; And I, of course, always reply with &quot;Scooter!&quot; But then, sometimes, I listen to something other than the mesmerising hard techno jumpstyle of H.P. Baxxter et al. So here are some recommendations of albums I&#39;ve been enjoying of late. They&#39;re not necessarily new, but hopefully some of them will be new to you!   </p>
<p>Most song/album links are to Spotify, but many will be available on other services too!   </p>
<h2 id="woodkid-the-golden-age"><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/46rGAcYt8T7iNyePUob4YO">Woodkid &#8211; The Golden Age</a></h2>
<p>I came across Woodkid through the amazing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmc21V-zBq0">video for Run Boy Run</a>, which is a combination of powerful music and great cinematography. The rest of The Golden Age really keeps up with Run Boy Run, which was great to discover, and makes great use of strong drum beats, vocals and horns.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1175" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1175" class="size-full wp-image-1175" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/kerfuffle-band.jpg" alt="Kerfuffle band" width="1000" height="1051" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/kerfuffle-band.jpg 1000w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/kerfuffle-band-285x300.jpg 285w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/kerfuffle-band-768x807.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/kerfuffle-band-625x657.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1175" class="wp-caption-text">Kerfuffle may have split up, but their music is still well worth a listen!</p></div>
<h2 id="kerfuffle-to-the-ground"><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/4YVxWK9vgW9n5n74K7CcTK">Kerfuffle &#8211; To The Ground</a></h2>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of buzz around folk music these days, which I think is fantastic. Meanwhile, Kerfuffle were one of the first folk bands I really fell in love with through their album K2; so I was delighted to find that one of their more recent albums is Spotify-ready. Particular favourite tracks are &quot;Dr Letcher&#39;s Favourite&quot; and &quot;Rondo&quot;. If you&#39;re into your Newton Faulkner and Mumford &amp; Sons, why not try something a bit more traditional?   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="kavinsky-outrun"><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3bRM4GQgoFjBRRzhp87Ugb">Kavinsky &#8211; OutRun</a></h2>
<p>This album is crazy. It sort of tells the story of some weird <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_(franchise)">Knight Rider</a> scenario where a car and man bond together into one and produce wonderful electronic music. I was recommended this album ages ago but forgot about it until a couple of weeks ago when I heard <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/73bDvrmSBh2fr53tLDH9oA">Nightcall</a> at a bar and insisted a friend Shazam&#39;d it. I&#39;m sure this album isn&#39;t for everyone but I really love it.   </p>
<h2 id="deadmau5-album-title-goes-here-"><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5cpwmGEav9fYtQi33w0YTj">Deadmau5 &#8211; &gt; album title goes here &lt;</a></h2>
<p>I really enjoy progressive house music, and in my eyes this album contains some of the best tracks going. I shan&#39;t dwell because it&#39;s pretty well-known and quite dividing. But if you like EDM and haven&#39;t got round to &gt; album title goes here &lt; yet, now&#39;s a great time.   </p>
<h2 id="various-artists-anjunabeats-volume-9"><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/2d3HW6qqAxA2zmtFROdhDO">Various Artists &#8211; Anjunabeats Volume 9</a></h2>
<p>This is a trance album from 2011, but it still pulls its weight. Some fantastic songs on here, and the flow throughout it is really good. Anjunabeats is the name of Above &amp; Beyond&#39;s record label, and this album contains of some of the label&#39;s best tracks from 2011. If you like this, also check out <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/667Wx9aZGwNdzl3QpFiu5U">Sirens Of The Sea</a> by OceanLab, which is made up of Above and Beyond and Justine Suissa.   </p>
<h2 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable mentions</h2>
<p>These albums are all fantastic too:<br /><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5EOAvD6xmE1g9XV49wFzNG">The Chemical Brothers &#8211; Further</a><br /><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3vyA5G1a5ISREXX0A4D2Iv">High Highs &#8211; Open Season</a><br /><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6MBuQugGuX7VMBX0uiBnAQ">M83 &#8211; Hurry Up, We&#39;re Dreaming</a>   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when online dating first kicked off, it was all quite simple. Millions of people created accounts, they were paired up based on their interests and, after picking their favourites, they would all go off and procreate. At least, that&#39;s how I assume it works. It&#39;s not really by area.   </p>
<p>At least, it wasn&#39;t. But I&#39;ve now entered the exciting world of online dating! The new trend in dating websites is to identify niches for people to search within, like <a href="http://www.uniformdating.com/">Uniform Dating</a> which pairs you with someone whose job involves them wearing or uniform. Or <a href="http://www.classicalmusiclover.co.uk/">Classical Music Lover</a> which connects users with a shared passion for classical music.   </p>
<p>My new site, <a href="http://gharmony.gregtyler.co.uk/">gHarmony</a> identifies a niche as well: Single, female, straight 20-somethings in Edinburgh. I created a unique algorithm that trawls through all one member of the site (myself), and identifies which match suits best. I include the algorithm below for those with a technical interest.   </p>
<pre><code>suitable = (isFemale &amp;&amp; likesMen &amp;&amp; isInTwenties &amp;&amp; isInEdinburgh);
if( suitable ) result = [&#39;Greg&#39;];
else result = [];</code></pre>
<p>Anyhow, have a peruse, give the match finder a try and find a suitable partner today on <a href="http://gharmony.gregtyler.co.uk/">gHarmony</a>!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the <a href="https://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a> is back! As a resident of the city, the Fringe brings equal parts joy of all the shows you can see and pain of all the tourists suddenly filling the streets. I like to think I&#39;m more on the &quot;joy&quot; bandwagon, but give it four weeks and we&#39;ll see if I&#39;m still feeling it.   </p>
<p>Anyhow, every year lots of great magazines and websites set out to review as much as possible. They do a really good job, but I like getting advice from friends rather than strangers. So this Fringe I&#39;m asking some of my mates to list the shows they&#39;d recommend and tell us why! Below you can find some of the top shows of the Edinburgh Fringe, as recommended by <strong>Greg and Pals</strong>.   </p>
<p>I&#39;ll be updating this as often as I can, so check back in through the month.   </p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, Matthew is a Fringe expert. He always seems to know what the best comedy shows around are.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently came back from a family holiday to Shetland. You might not know much about the archipelago, but it&#39;s very far north. Further north, in fact, than anywhere else in the UK.   </p>
<p>During the trip, we went to the most northern of this northern archipelago to spent some time on Britain&#39;s most northerly inhabited island, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unst">Unst</a>.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1203" style="width: 2314px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1203" class="size-full wp-image-1203" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/shetland-unst-boat.jpg" alt="Photo from the ferry to Unst" width="2304" height="1728" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/shetland-unst-boat.jpg 2304w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/shetland-unst-boat-300x225.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/shetland-unst-boat-768x576.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/shetland-unst-boat-625x469.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 2304px) 100vw, 2304px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1203" class="wp-caption-text">On the ferry to Unst</p></div>
<p>As well as having much longer summer days, being so far north has the benefit that you can easily advertise everything there as being &quot;the most far north X in Britain!&quot; So we used Britain&#39;s most northerly car ferry, bought some bread from Britain&#39;s most northerly bakery and sent a letter from Britain&#39;s most northerly post office.   </p>
<p>There were some slightly weirder places to see. We stopped for coffee at Britain&#39;s most northerly café-based-in-an-old-double-decker-bus, and I think we saw Britain&#39;s most northerly MoD listening outpost but, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa">given recent events</a>, I probably shouldn&#39;t discuss that.   </p>
<p>On our second day on Unst, I decided to up the game. Rather than letting the most northerly things come to me, I wanted to go and seek them out. Specifically, I decided to search for Britain&#39;s most northerly sheep.   </p>
<p>The search took place on Hermaness, a headland on Unst that affords excellent views of the vast expanse of nothingness contained in the Atlantic ocean. The whole headland is a nature reserve, complete with puffins, Great Skua and, fortunately for my plans, sheep. It also overlooks the most northerly _un_-inhabited island of Britain, <a href="http://www.nlb.org.uk/Lighthouse.aspx?id=783">Muckle Flugga</a>, which is possibly my favourite island name ever.   </p>

<p>As we walked across Hermaness, I got excited by every sheep I saw, stating that it <em>must</em> be the most northerly, surely. But every time, another one would appear around the next corner.   </p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until we went as far north as we realistically could that I finally found my quarry. Standing on the final outcrop, looking out at Muckle Flugga Lighthouse, I spotted a sheep just over the crest of a rise to my east. I pulled out my camera and took a photo of what was, frankly, a rather heroic pose. Almost as if she knew.   </p>

<p>This was, according to my camera, at about 60.84 degrees North. With just five metres to the cliffs and sea below, it was about as far North as I ever could have hoped.   </p>
<p>But the story doesn&#39;t end there. Just after I put the camera away I glimpsed, just for a second, a sheep perched precariously on the cliffs to the north. It was as far as it could possibly be, seemingly centimetres from falling to its death. Before I could get the camera out, the sheep disappeared over the edge, presumably onto a ledge out of my sight.   </p>
<p>I&#39;ve got no evidence of this very, very far north sheep; but I swear it was there, all fluffy and care-free. Maybe she didn&#39;t realise quite how different she was at that moment, further north than the other 32 million sheep (data from the <a href="http://www.nationalsheep.org.uk/education.php">NSA</a>) in Britain, but she was a very special sheep indeed.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, a friend of mine recommended I watch the TV show <em>Hellcats</em>. I asked why. He said &quot;it&#39;s about cheerleaders&quot;. I said, &quot;right&quot;. Thus ended his review. So I thought I&#39;d make a bit more effort to review what was one of the strangest series I&#39;ve watched in the past couple of years.   </p>
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> This review contains spoilers. But since I don&#39;t recommend watching the show anyway, you might as well just read on.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p><em>Hellcats</em> is about a group of cheerleaders by the same name at the fake Lancer University in Memphis, Tennessee. As some of the best cheerleaders in the country (apparently that&#39;s a thing), they want to compete in the national cheerleading competition. Welcome, once again, to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQtVmGO3cu4">the regional/sectional/semis debacle</a>.   </p>
<p>Whilst all this dancing is going on, we follow the story of Marti who is forced to join this eponymous Hellcats squad to earn her scholarship, so she can study law and change the entire legal landscape. Also, Marti&#39;s trying to find her estranged, supposedly-dead father, and everyone&#39;s copping off with each other. Standard college life really.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1165" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1165" class="size-full wp-image-1165" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-poster.jpg" alt="Poster for Hellcats" width="680" height="1000" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-poster.jpg 680w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-poster-204x300.jpg 204w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-poster-625x919.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1165" class="wp-caption-text">If anyone can explain that tagline to me, I&#39;d appreciate it. Also, what&#39;s up with Marti&#39;s mouth? Who the hell okay&#39;ed this poster?</p></div>
<h2 id="where-it-all-begins">Where it all begins</h2>
<p>The pilot of <em>Hellcats</em> is deeply strange. Marti finds out she needs a scholarship and then that she can get one by joining the Hellcats. She sniggers at this, perhaps associating with the audience that yes, cheerleading is dumb. But by the end of the episode she is not only happy to be part of the squad but is already an integral member.   </p>
<p>I get that this is setup, but I feel like the writers burnt a great plot point immediately. The fish out of water story of a rock chic who doesn&#39;t quite fit in could&#39;ve been great to watch, but is spent in the first forty minutes of the season. There&#39;s also next to no explanation of why Marti is so good at this cheerleading malarkey. She can do backflips and all sorts, and no surprise is made by her or her teammates that no education was needed.   </p>
<p>It&#39;s all as if Marti was previously with a rival cheerleading squad, where she learned the trade, but then came to infiltrate the Hellcats to destroy their morale before sectionals. To keep up the ruse, she acted at first like she didn&#39;t fit in at all, but the façade faded rather quickly. Now <em>that</em> would&#39;ve been an interested plot!   </p>
<h2 id="tight-jeans-double-d-s-makin-me-go-whoo-whoo">Tight jeans, Double D&#39;s makin&#39; me go whoo-whoo</h2>
<p>So, yeah, cheerleading. Perhaps as over-sexualised as a &quot;sport&quot; can be. That&#39;s probably where the idea of this show came from, an executive imagining pretty girls dancing around in short skirts and going &quot;oh, throw some drama about cheating and teenage pregnancy in there to keep it moving&quot;. Indeed, despite the weird subplots to do with Savannah&#39;s sister and the &quot;pay for play&quot; culture the University apparently had (and still has? It was all a bit confusing), the focus of the show is very much on cheerleading.   </p>
<p>Along with Marti&#39;s sudden conversion to cheerleading fanboyism, we also get a great insight into how Savannah (Marti&#39;s flatmate and the second-billing character) has changed personality completely during her time with the Hellcats. Prior to joining Lancer, we&#39;re told that Savannah was in a religious school called &quot;Memphis Christian&quot; or, wait for it, &quot;Mem-Chris&quot;. The cheerleaders at Mem-Chris are more reserved, almost as if they&#39;re in direct competition with the Hellcats to cover/reveal as much flesh as possible. This is, the characters tell us, rather silly and abnormal.   </p>
<p>Anyhow, Savannah transfers between these backgrounds and, having previously been something of a prude, rather quickly surrounds herself in Lancer&#39;s world of sex and partying without much of a look back. It&#39;s quite depressing really. Everyone I know who came to University reserved (which isn&#39;t a bad thing), has left through the same door. Savannah acts like a child who&#39;s just been hanging around with older kids and thinks she has to do everything they do. Of course, this dramatic change is only ever alluded to in the context of people supporting it and saying how much better off she is having deserted her morals, family and childhood.   </p>
<p>The sexualisation does lead to my favourite part of the show though, where some of the Hellcats female members are asked to dance a bit for older men who fund the school&#39;s athletics department. The girls act shocked at the idea that they might be being used for the good looks and physique, rather than displaying their sporting potential. All this arguing of course takes place whilst they wear their standard short skirts and layers of makeup.   </p>
<p>I love that part because I can&#39;t tell if the writers are making a joke at cheerleaders, or somehow admitting shame at the low-brow entertainment they&#39;ve written. It&#39;s an almost fourth-wall breaking moment.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1164" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1164" class="size-full wp-image-1164" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-cast.jpg" alt="The main cast of Hellcats" width="1200" height="450" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-cast.jpg 1200w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-cast-300x113.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-cast-768x288.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/hellcats-cast-625x234.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1164" class="wp-caption-text">Marti, Savannah, Alice and Dan. All wearing more clothes than you&#39;re used to seeing them in.</p></div>
<h2 id="noooo-oooone-exists-like-gaston-">Noooo-oooone exists like Gaston!</h2>
<p>Every piece of dramatic writing needs a baddie. They add conflict, and lead plots by challenging the otherwise plainly happy situation of the main characters. <em>Hellcats</em> doesn&#39;t seem to like keeping a baddie. In the pilot, Savannah acts like she might be Marti&#39;s nemesis, but then they bunk together and become instant pals. Alice takes over the baddie role for a while, but then has an annoying habit of saving the day when it <em>really</em> goes down.   </p>
<p>Ultimately, there&#39;s a move towards the senior staff being the baddies, but Red Raymond turns out to be a thoroughly alright kind of guy, leaving Bill Marsh as the last remaining negative figure. Indeed, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0234928/">Aaron Douglas</a> does an outstanding job playing an evil character who, at one point, organises a hit in a prison. The problem is, Marsh&#39;s whole storyline about pay for play only tangentially affects the Hellcats at all. It&#39;s like having Crabbe and Goyle as the main baddies in Harry Potter: sure, they&#39;re not top blokes, but you have to work hard to fit them in the plot.   </p>
<p>Personally I think Marti&#39;s mum is the baddie in all of this. She does very little to help people and normally just makes the situation worse. In the end though, I just wound up hating everyone.   </p>
<h2 id="location-location-location">Location, location, location</h2>
<p><em>Hellcats</em> obviously has a pretty solid budget for their sets; and they want to use that budget. In fact, sometimes it feels like the realms of normality are sacrificed purely to fit in a strange new set. Take for example, the plot when the Hellcats get in an argument with a local, unknown band. To conclude the argument, the band invite the squad to their rehearsal space to perform.   </p>
<p>The girls show up (in full costume, of course) to what appears to be a warehouse. Now I&#39;ll accept that maybe it&#39;s a space owned by one of the band&#39;s parents, but there is no explanation at all as to why the warehouse has a fairly complex lighting rig (which someone inexplicably operates) or a regulation-size spring-loaded cheerleading floor. Maybe this is just American culture, and it&#39;s a common occurrence for cheerleaders to pop over and practice a routine in front of you.   </p>
<p>On the other side of the location coin, sometimes it seems like the show&#39;s producers forgot to build a set. In this situation, the group&#39;s favourite bar is pretty consistently used to fill in. Confidential and very personal meeting about a missing father? Meet me at the bar! My favourite is when Dan goes to his first class of film school and, rather than using Lancer&#39;s acres of educational real estate, they meet in the bar and awkwardly talk about cinematography surrounded by people trying to enjoy a quick pint.   </p>
<h2 id="all-together-now-">All together now!</h2>
<p><em>Hellcats</em> stars Aly Michalka and Ashley Tisdale, who are both products of the Disney Channel. So it only seems right that there&#39;s a good old sing-song at least once an episode, right? Sometimes twice, if you&#39;re lucky. Of course, everyone in Lancer has a fantastic singing voice, despite the Glee-esque range of music covered. However, since this isn&#39;t a musical and the plot doesn&#39;t revolve around music like <em>Glee</em> does, the songs just don&#39;t really fit.   </p>
<p>A musical highlight is the Toga Party held in episode 15, in which Lewis breaks into a rendition of The Isley Brothers&#39; song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An5WJC8eJjI">Shout</a>. This is as much a homage to National Lampoon&#39;s Animal House as Will.I.Am&#39;s music is &quot;gently influenced&quot; by the rest of the music industry. I imagine the script for the scene went something along the lines of:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lewis takes the microphone and performs the scene from Animal House for five minutes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Oh, I enjoyed it really. <em>Hellcats</em> has as many holes in it as a block of Emmental, and it&#39;s fun to rip on. But I love ripping on shows so that turned out just right. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it though. Go watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlashForward">FlashForward</a> instead. Now <em>there&#39;s</em> a show that deserved a second season.   </p>
<p>Have you seen Hellcats and want to weigh in? Maybe you know another TV show I might enjoy ripping on? The discussion continues below!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a lecture series last year, I wanted to spice up the hour-long sessions we had. I spent a lot of time drawing, and tried writing notes in different languages. But during one such lecture I wrote my notes like a play, in rhyming couplets. After some vague interest from others, and for the sake of posterity, I thought I&#39;d put them up here.   </p>
<p>It&#39;s not a masterpiece. The meter is all over the place, there are a lot of half-rhymes and I&#39;m not certain the maths holds up. But considering that I wrote it in fifty minutes with no preparation, I&#39;m really proud of it. I was tempted to clean up some of the off-bits, but I&#39;ve chosen to leave it totally unedited. This is very much the &quot;without makeup&quot; version.   </p>
<p>So please enjoy what I&#39;ve since named <strong>Much Ado about Noetherian Rings</strong>. A play in one Act.   </p>

<h2 id="scene-1-a-port-of-florence">Scene 1: A port of Florence</h2>
<p><em>(Enter ANTONIO and GAIUS)</em>   </p>
<p>Antonio: Recall, brother, the characteristic of a field.   </p>
<p>Gaius: The smallest positive integer such that as many ones that are summed make nought?   </p>
<p>Antonio: The exact same. Remember thee that it is prime or infinite?   </p>
<p>Gaius: Alas, I missed such a fact.   </p>
<p>Antonio: Now form a field of sums of one, up until they add to none.<br />The suppose that n is p times q, both primes I should be telling you.   </p>
<p>Gaius: Then a sum of n is a sum of primes, but these be nought in any time!<br />Hence we find a contradiction, and conclude with some conviction.<br />That n cannot be p times q, and only if it&#39;s prime will do!   </p>
<p>Antonio: Now theorise that in a field, then in it thy fate is sealed.<br />There exists a number pn, with p a prime, the other in ℕ.<br />I shan&#39;t prove this in great detail, but an outline surely cannot fail.<br />Note ℤp is a linear subspace, and that it works with an F-basis.<br />So any a in F can be written unique, amongst the basis ℤp of which we speak.   </p>
<p>Gaius: I&#39;m afraid brother that I don&#39;t get it!   </p>
<p>Antonio: Perhaps t&#39;would help to see it writ.<br />Here I show you an example, with f(x) an irreducible polynomial,<br />which has as n its degree, and coefficients in ℤp.<br />Now let me fall and show to you, the following is certainly true.<br />The answer, it is sealed, this ℤp[x] / f(x)ℤp[x] is a field.   </p>
<p>See, brother, that the powers of x can form a basis of cosets.<br /><a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/blog/files/2013/04/sumton.gif">1</a>, [x], [x2], [xn-1] certainly form a linear space on,<br />ℤp, our set of coefficients, and to show they span you must be proficient.<br />Each element it is in the sum (<img class="size-full wp-image-1204" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/sumton.gif" alt="sum^n_{i=0}" width="48" height="22" /> αi[xi], αi ∈ ℤ), so the cosets span everyone.<br />Since each αi has options p, there are pn choices we can see.<br />Now find a field with elements 9, and waste not any of our time.   </p>
<p><em>(Enter HERMIUS, a nobleman)</em>   </p>
<p>Hermius: What trivial games you merchants play, sitting by the docks all day.<br />With 9 elements, take p as 3, and n as 2 so we can see<br />that ℤ3[x] / f(x)ℤ3[x] is irreducible, in all f(x) of degree 2.   </p>
<p>Gaius: And we know a polynomial with degree ≤ 3 only displays irreducibility,<br />if it has no factor in F, and hence no root but alone, bereft.   </p>
<p>Hermius: Indeed, so after all this fun, take f(x) to be x2 1.   </p>
<p>Antonio: But can you form me one with eight?   </p>
<p>Gaius: Nay in time, unless we have &#39;til late.   </p>
<p>Hermius: Foolish boy, this is easy, take p as 2 and n as 3.<br />Now form the field shown here (ℤ3[x] / f(x)ℤ3[x]) and let f(x) appear.<br />This f(x) is of degree 3 and in ℤ2[x] shows irreducibility.<br />Try f(x)=x3 x 1, and see that f(x)=0 gives none.<br />In integers of course!   </p>
<p><em>(Exit HERMIUS and enter SERAFINA)</em>   </p>
<p>Serafina: Merchant men, if you&#39;ll hear me, let me provide to you a little theory.<br />That if n is a number we call natural, then an isomorphism will certainly fall.<br />Upon ℤ/nℤ and ℤn where ℤn has modulus addition.<br />And that if F in K are both fields, with f(x) irreducible in F[X]&#39;s shield,<br />take α in K so that it evaluated gives none, then note again an isomorphism.<br />Here of F[x]/f(x)F[x] and the F[α] polynomial set.   </p>
<p>Antonio: May we call F[α] a simple extension?   </p>
<p>Serafina: Yes, of F. I forgot to mention.<br />I bid you proof, that much I owe, and with the 1st isomorphism theorem I shall show.<br />Form g from F[x] to F[α], and by ker(g) we can solve her.<br />Say F were ℝ and K be ℂ, take α=√1 instantly,<br />Then ℝ[x] / (x2 1)ℝ[x] to ℂ they will be isomorphics.   </p>
<p>Gaius: Such odd remarks you make today, of field extensions you continue to say.<br />But let us return to the matter of codes, and see that cyclic ones can be showed.<br />Take a word in a code and if it may be, that that at the end at the start we may see,<br />If this be true for any code word, then to a cyclic code we have referred.<br />Note too that there are more criteria, a cyclic code it must be linear!   </p>
<p>Antonio: Tell me more of cyclic shift, a concept I&#39;ve heard is of some thrift.   </p>
<p>Gaius: It&#39;s much what it sounds like brother, a smooth connection as that between lovers.<br />Take the last digit of a word and add it to the start, a cyclic shift has occurred in such a lover&#39;s heart.   </p>
<p>Serafina: Could a polynomial be moved by such a lover?   </p>
<p>Gaius: Aye, my lady, and we&#39;d discover<br />the coefficients are what make the code, so 1 x2 x4 is 10101 showed.<br />Then a=10101 is a ring, Rn (=F[x]/(xn-1)F[x]) is the notation we bring.   </p>
<p>Serafina: What really can we see from this?   </p>
<p>Gaius: That x*a(x) is a cyclic shift.   </p>
<p>Serafina: You speak with such determination, could you show some explanation?   </p>
<p>Gaius: Alas, time falls but trust my lady, I believe you can see it may be.   </p>
<p><em>(A priest gives Serafina a potion, making her appear dead. Gaius flees, wrought with grief, and Serafina awakes cold and alone.)</em>   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two days, many mathematicians at Edinburgh University went to their final lectures and workshops of four years. Together we made it through the horrors of Group Theory, Probability and the almost comical organisation of final year projects; but it&#39;s hard to look back now and not think of it as the best four years so far.   </p>
<p>On Thursday a load of us got together with a camera and our good friend Matthew Crisp took a photo to cement some of those memories.   </p>
<p>I thought it would be nice to get the names of everyone in the photo so here, with a few embarrassing omissions, is a list of <em>some</em> of the great people I got to study with.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">3rd most visited site</a> on the Internet. It&#8217;s available in 61 languages and, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html">72 hours of content uploaded every minute</a>, it caters for hundreds of millions of users. Inevitably, designing your site to please every one of those people is an impossible task.</p>
<p>YouTube certainly gains a lot of commentary regarding its layout and design (perhaps second only to Facebook, who sometimes seem to have one of the most unhappy user bases of all time), and I&#8217;m sure we can all point out things that we&#8217;d like done differently. I made my own list, and I started to fix it.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-d-like-to-see-in-youtube-s-design">Things I&#8217;d like to see in YouTube&#8217;s design</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bigger videos: that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m there!</li>
<li>Inline comments: I want to be able to browse comments whilst still watching the video (this has some very specific use cases)</li>
<li>Less &#8220;gunf&#8221;: I rarely use &#8220;related videos&#8221;, or the navigation to the side</li>
<li>Better usage of the screen: Full width on big displays, a responsive solution on smaller screens</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t work for YouTube so I couldn&#8217;t roll out &#8220;proper&#8221; changes but, as a web developer, I decided to make a Chrome extension that made this improvements for me. In basic terms, it allows me to run little scripts every time I open a YouTube video is loaded. It&#8217;s all done after the page had finished loading so, in case it breaks, everything just fall back to the standard YouTube display.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the extension broke the day after I wrote it when YouTube changed some of their code. So I can guarantee the fallback plan works!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how YouTube looks now:</p>
<div id="attachment_1219" style="width: 1360px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1219" class="size-full wp-image-1219" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-large.png" alt="Screenshot of a YouTube video in my new layout" width="1350" height="1197" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-large.png 1350w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-large-300x266.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-large-768x681.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-large-625x554.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1219" class="wp-caption-text">ImprovEverywhere&#8217;s Backwards Times Square prank on my new layout, complete with comments from people who don&#8217;t understand magic</p></div>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve fixed some of my big issues. The page now centres around the video, which takes up most of the page. In fact, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold">fold</a> of the page is just below the video (on widescreens like mine), so it takes up a solid two thirds of the visible page.</p>
<p>Comments are on the right and, since their container is the same size as the video, I can scroll through them whilst watching. You&#8217;ll notice too that some of the options surrounding the comments have disappeared. I took out the &#8220;reply&#8221; button and the up/down votes. Ultimately, YouTube&#8217;s comments have a lot of problems, and I thought I could start to alleviate some of them by making comments stand up on their own.</p>
<h2 id="smaller-screens">Smaller screens</h2>
<p>Perhaps more exciting is the responsive solution I have. I often watch videos in a small window on my screen whilst having something else open in another window (a word document, say). I wanted to make sure that YouTube would still be just as usable when I shrank the screen down, rather than overflowing from the window.</p>
<div id="attachment_1214" style="width: 983px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1214" class="size-full wp-image-1214" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-small.png" alt="A before and after comparison of YouTube, shrunken to a smaller window." width="973" height="555" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-small.png 973w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-small-300x171.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-small-768x438.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/youtube-small-625x357.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1214" class="wp-caption-text">A before and after comparison of YouTube, shrunken to a smaller window.</p></div>
<p>On smaller windows, my redesign makes sure that the video fills exactly the width of the page. There&#8217;s no overflow, and there&#8217;s no wasted space around the sides. The comments appear below, again giving them pride of place. Below that, on all screen sizes, the video information appears, completely unchanged.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-what-s-left-to-do">Results, and what&#8217;s left to do</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m really happy with my new YouTube design. Some things that really bugged me have now been drastically improved. I know this isn&#8217;t a global &#8220;fix&#8221; and that other people would want other changes made, but it&#8217;s exciting to be able to move things around to my liking.</p>
<p>When I get some time, I&#8217;d like to play a bit more with the header and with the video information. They don&#8217;t really work responsively, which can be a slight pain. There&#8217;s also drastic changes I&#8217;d like to make to comments.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, I think comments should be &#8220;recommended for you&#8221;, so you can highlight comments from your friends and people you&#8217;ve voted up before. Downvoting comments should mean that all comments that user makes in the future will be rated down as well.</p>
<p>However, this requires more than a slight design change and I&#8217;d have to start saving up and down votes. Maybe when I&#8217;ve got <em>a lot</em> more free time&#8230;</p>
<p>What would you change about YouTube&#8217;s design?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This evening (Tuesday 15th 2013), Facebook had an unexpected press event inviting journalists to &quot;come see what we&#39;re building&quot;. There was speculation about a revamp to Timeline, and even a Facebook phone. Instead, Facebook announced their &quot;third pillar&quot;.   </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at 1800 GMT to explain about Facebook&#39;s three pillars. The first is the News Feed, which tells us what everyone&#39;s been doing lately. The second is Timeline, which lets us focus in on one person and find out more about their life. The third, and new, pillar is &quot;Graph Search&quot;, which is exactly what it sounds like.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1162" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-movies.png" alt="Screenshot-MoviesMyFriendsLike" width="1262" height="929" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-movies.png 1262w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-movies-300x221.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-movies-768x565.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-movies-625x460.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px" /></p>
<p>For years (since its inception really), Facebook has accumulated loads of data on all of us. We tell Facebook our relationships status, the languages we speak and the films we like. Up until now, those things have just been statistics on profile page, unexplorable.   </p>
<p>Graph Search allows for natural language queries. That is, you can ask it to find &quot;My friends who like Game of Thrones&quot;, and it&#39;ll do just that. It extends across most of the network, primarily incorporating likes, places and people. Ultimately, you can search for &quot;My friends in Edinburgh who like Lord of the Rings and are students&quot; to organise the ultimate viewing party.   </p>
<h2 id="complex-queries">Complex queries</h2>
<p>As well as finding your friends, you&#39;ll be able to explore the graph at different levels. For example, if you were at a friends birthday and met someone called Chris who went to Stanford, you could search Facebook for &quot;People named Chris who are friends of Lars and went to Stanford University&quot;. No longer should hazy memories from nights out limit you keeping in touch with the people you met!   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1161" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-chris.png" alt="Screenshot-PeopleNamedChris" width="1257" height="779" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-chris.png 1257w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-chris-300x186.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-chris-768x476.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-chris-625x387.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1257px) 100vw, 1257px" /></p>
<p>Higher up the social graph, you can find &quot;Bars in Dublin liked by people who live in Dublin&quot; with aggregated results to find you the best bars in the Irish capital, according to locals. One example Facebook demonstrated at their event too was &quot;Music liked by people who like Mitt Romney&quot; which, if nothing else, will be very interesting to statisticians.   </p>
<p>A particularly nice demonstration was &quot;Videos by TV shows my friends like&quot;, which immediately provided an index of clips from Archer, 30 Rock and the other most popular shows amongst your community.   </p>
<p>For searches where Facebook can&#39;t help (&quot;Weather in Edinburgh&quot;, &quot;Bon Iver&#39;s latest album&quot;), Bing is now nicely integrated to search the rest of the web. Says Mark Zuckerberg, &quot;We don&#39;t think a lot of people will come to Facebook to do web searches, but if we can&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for, it&#39;s good to have this.&quot;   </p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Predominantly, the navigation bar at the top of Facebook is changing.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1160" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos.png" alt="Screenshot-SearchBar" width="1417" height="372" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos.png 1417w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos-300x79.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos-768x202.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos-625x164.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1417px) 100vw, 1417px" /></p>
<p>The focus now is absolutely on Graph Search, and as you start typing into the box Facebook will provide possible queries you might consider.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1160" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos.png" alt="Screenshot-SearchBar-Photos" width="1417" height="372" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos.png 1417w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos-300x79.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos-768x202.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-bar-photos-625x164.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1417px) 100vw, 1417px" /></p>
<p>On each results page is an area where you can &quot;refine your search&quot; to non-verbally change what you&#39;re looking for. It also provides some suggestions of more detailed searches you might perform.   </p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<div id="attachment_1163" style="width: 379px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1163" class="size-full wp-image-1163" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-privacy.png" alt="Now you can quickly access your privacy options from any Facebook page." width="369" height="288" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-privacy.png 369w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/facebook-graph-search-privacy-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1163" class="wp-caption-text">Now you can quickly access your privacy options from any Facebook page.</p></div>
<p>As with every product Facebook releases there are questions about privacy, and there will continue to be people who don&#39;t understand but I&#39;ll point out here that <em>privacy settings are the same as everywhere else on Facebook</em>. If you don&#39;t let strangers see your account, they can&#39;t search for you. If you hide certain bits of data, like your relationship status, you won&#39;t show up in search results for &quot;friends of friends who are single&quot; or similar.   </p>
<p>In fact, Facebook noted that 10% of their worldwide computing power is put towards calculating privacy settings and determining whether a certain nugget of data should be visible to you.   </p>
<p>If you&#39;re a privacy worrier, you can use your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/me/allactivity">Activity Log</a> to check who can see certain bits of information about you. There&#39;s also a privacy shortcut button in the top right-hand corner of Facebook now.   </p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-great">Why this is great</h2>
<p>Frankly, this is what we should expect from a &quot;social network&quot;. The ability to actually browse information socially and use it to find interesting new things, like music that our friends recommend, is the entire raison d&#39;être for social networks. Rather than friends having to write posts saying &quot;you should listen to this band&quot; or &quot;you should check out this restaurant&quot;, we can now find those things organically, when we want to know.   </p>
<p>Also, Facebook search has always been crap. Funny how they flipped that round.   </p>
<h2 id="want-to-know-more-sign-up-for-the-beta-">Want to know more? Sign up for the beta?</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch">sign up for the beta now</a>. Meanwhile, global releases over the next &quot;weeks or months&quot; for everyone else.   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to the unique way in which students pick which films to see, I recently found myself with my male flatmates watching a film about an a-capella band and their struggles in American varsity a-capella tournaments. I wasn&#39;t hugely psyched but honestly, _honestly_, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981677/">Pitch Perfect</a> is fantastic. Though it&#39;s little surprise I enjoyed it, as the movie has respect for one of my greatest loves: mash-ups.   </p>
<p>The rest of this post contains <strong>spoilers</strong>. If you haven&#39;t seen Pitch Perfect yet, stop reading, go and watch it, then come back. Watching a film sucks when you know what&#39;s coming. Be surprised, <em>then</em> finish this post.</p>
<p>Right. Spoiler zone.</p>
<p>As with most American high school films, Pitch Perfect juggles the usual issues of how to gain acceptance in a society that is based around huge cliques when you don&#39;t fall into such a stereotype. However, there were some extra bits of knowledge that I gleamed from the film that I thought I&#39;d share with you now.   </p>
<h2 id="you-can-tell-a-lot-about-someone-by-the-headphones">You can tell a lot about someone by the headphones</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start with Beca&#39;s rival in this film, Aubrey. Boo! Hiss! Well, not really. She&#39;s not so much a baddie as misplaced. Aubrey doesn&#39;t <em>try</em> to destroy the Bellas, but its her lack of appreciation for modern music that screws her over. And what would you expect from someone who is only shown listening to music through a Bluetooth headset?   </p>
<div id="attachment_1188" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1188" class="size-full wp-image-1188" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pitch-perfect-beca.jpg" alt="Picture of Beca in Pitch Perfect wearing a pair of headphones" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pitch-perfect-beca.jpg 1000w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pitch-perfect-beca-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pitch-perfect-beca-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/pitch-perfect-beca-625x417.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1188" class="wp-caption-text">Beca is wearing a pair of Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones</p></div>
<p>Taking a step up we find Aubrey&#39;s number two, Chloe. She seems to be open to the idea of pulling out some more modern tunes, perhaps because she has a better appreciation of modern music. Tellingly, Chloe doesn&#39;t listen to music on a Bluetooth device, but through real earphones.   </p>
<p>And then at the top of the pile is Beca. She first arrives at college with a pair of Sony MDR7506 round her neck, and then later upgrades to a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO (which retail at almost £200). No wonder she wants to bring some <em>real</em> music to the Bellas!   </p>
<h2 id="beca-was-never-in-it-for-the-bellas">Beca was never in it for the Bellas</h2>
<p>The only reason Beca joined the Bellas in the first place is that, by joining a society, she fulfills her dad&#39;s criteria for moving to Los Angeles. Caring little for the group, she goes against their wishes by getting in cosy with Jesse despite being told to keep away from the rival Treblemakers. In her big move of the film, Beca suddenly throws a mashup into the Bellas&#39; set and throws everyone off their game. It&#39;s as if she&#39;s toying with the girls, testing them to their very nerves.   </p>
<p>At the end of the film, Beca goes for broke and works songs from The Breakfast Club into the Bella&#39;s set list, purely so that she can get Jesse to like her again. It&#39;s selfish really, and you wonder how Beca wasn&#39;t placed as the film&#39;s antagonist!   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we come to the end of the year, it&#39;s time to all write our reviews of the most important events. The best films, the best clothes and, of course, the best mashups.   </p>
<p>As you may know, I&#39;m a huge fan of mashups. I can&#39;t really explain why, but there&#39;s something amazing about listening to two songs at once. In particular, I love hearing a classic track with something new over the top.   </p>
<p>There have been some great mashups this year and I wanted to pay tribute to some of the best. I was going to rank a Top 3, but I&#39;ve opted to just list some and not worry about which was the best. Because mashups aren&#39;t about picking a favourite, they&#39;re about enjoying as many favourites as you can at once!   </p>
<p><strong>Carly Rae Jepsen vs. Porter Robinson &#8211; Petty Language</strong><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49hFJNj32rc">Listen on YouTube</a>   </p>
<p>Porter Robinson&#39;s Language was one of my top tunes of the summer. It got into the radio, into clubs and still sits on my mp3 player. Meanwhile, Call Me Maybe was in everyone&#39;s hearts for all sorts of reasons. For me, it was the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu9qTMDZ2ww">Freshers&#39; Week</a>, where volunteering was my highlight of the year. All said, it&#39;s no surprise that this crossover features on my favourites list. It&#39;s simple, but it&#39;s lovely.   </p>
<p><strong>PSY vs. Ghostbusters &#8211; Gangnam Busters</strong><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82LCKBdjywQ">Listen on YouTube</a>   </p>
<p>This mashup dropped at just the right time, right before Halloween. The combination of &quot;currently popular track&quot; and &quot;Halloween classic&quot; was an inspired idea, and I know that it played at parties across the world. I seem to recall that <a href="http://www.freshair.org.uk/">Fresh Air</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebigcheese.ed">The Big Cheese</a> were big fans too. The thing that really makes this track though, in my eyes, is the build-up you get. It&#39;s obvious for the first minute or so what&#39;s coming up, but when he finally shouts &quot;Oppa! Gangnam Style&quot; at 1:21, it feels like the perfect setup.   </p>
<p><strong>The Cut Up Boys Commercial Dance Mix</strong><br /><a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-cut-up-boys/the-cut-up-boys-commercial">Listen on Soundcloud</a>   </p>
<p>Okay, so this isn&#39;t a mashup per sé. This half hour track by The Cut Up Boys combines some of the best songs in recent times, and mixes them all incredibly. I saw The Cut Up Boys live this year and it was one of the best gigs I can remember. They played a long set and the mixing was truly sublime. I&#39;ve listened through this particular mix several times and thrown it on at parties and events too. It always gets a great response.   </p>
<p><strong>deadmau5 vs. Swedish House Mafia &#8211; Professional Greyhounds</strong>   </p>
<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a sample of this to play, but it was still one of my favourite mashups of the year. The lead-in to Greyhound goes on for a minute or so, which is just about long enough to mix in a verse of Professional Griefers by deadmau5. Then, just as Greyhound drops in, so too does the chorus of Professional Griefers. It&#39;s a very simple mashup (since they have the same BPM, you just play one over the top of t&#39;other), but it just damn works.   </p>
<p>So there you are: some great mashups of 2012. I&#39;d love to also compile a list of some of my favourite tracks of the year, but it would just go on and on. But I can&#39;t leave that so dry, so here&#39;s a bonus few highlights of 2012 songs:   </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmc21V-zBq0">Woodkid &#8211; Run Boy Run</a> (From an O2 advert)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHYMWzigoY">Kilo ft. Alana &#8211; Scream</a> (Finally this is on YouTube! I heard a preview ages ago. Incredible song)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je8UCmQ45h4">Modestep &#8211; Show Me A Sign</a> (Dubstep the way I like it)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj3_3vvHDwE">Elbow &#8211; First Steps</a> (From the BBC&#39;s Olympic coverage. See also: All of the original Opening Ceremony music)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, 2012, you&#39;ve been an incredible year for music. Let&#39;s hope 2013 can bring more glorious tunes!   </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the 2 Player Productions documentary &quot;Minecraft: The Story of Mojang&quot;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a> gives an amazing analogy of how Minecraft has inversely charted the change in Lego.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s really interesting how Lego at the moment is like traditional games design. It&#39;s: Buy the box, open the box, turn to the instruction sheet, make the models, stick it on the shelf, buy the next box. That&#39;s <em>exactly</em> like traditional game design: Buy the game, go through the challenges, finish the challenges, stick it on the shelf, buy the next game.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Where Lego <em>used to be</em> just a big box of bricks and you used to take the bricks, pour them on the carpet, and then make stuff. And that&#39;s exactly what Minecraft is.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://redux.com/minecraft-movie">Minecraft: The Story of Mojang</a> is available now for $8 (~£5), and also for free on the Pirate Bay. It&#39;s well worth a watch. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Responsive web design has had an amazing year in 2012, and will surely continue to push across the internet in 2013. This year we&#39;ve seen some huge sites get on board the Responsive train, including <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/12/04/new-mashable/">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/">The BBC</a> and, heck, <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">the most powerful man in the world</a>, and I thought I&#39;d write a post on my own personal comments of developing in a responsive environment.   </p>
<div id="attachment_1140" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1140" class="size-full wp-image-1140" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bbc-mobile-2010.png" alt="BBC Mobile site 2010" width="320" height="1020" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bbc-mobile-2010.png 320w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/bbc-mobile-2010-94x300.png 94w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1140" class="wp-caption-text">BBC Mobile site 2010</p></div>
<h2 id="what-is-responsive-web-design-">What is Responsive web design?</h2>
<p>Our story with Responsive design starts on mobile phones. When our mobiles started gaining internet access, there was a growing demand for web developers to react and provide a version of their site that suited the small, handheld interface. Initially, this was achieved by creating a &quot;mobile&quot; version of the site. I particularly remember the BBC being a strong supporter of mobile sites, with specially-made versions of their homepage, news and sports sites.   </p>
<p>Web apps got on the scene too, and the mobile versions of <a href="https://m.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com">Twitter</a> are perfectly accessible on any device, and well worth a look.   </p>
<h2 id="it-couldn-t-last-">It couldn&#39;t last&#8230;</h2>
<p>The mobile sites worked well for a long while, but soon a new problem reared its head. As smart phones came into the market, screen sizes got bigger and mobile sites seemed somewhat lacking. Then tablets showed up with their &quot;just slightly smaller than a laptop&quot; screen size, and they just didn&#39;t have a natural home. Mobile sites looked ridiculous scaled up but any site designed to fit at 1000px (a fairly standard design size) would look squashed up on a tablet&#39;s, say, 768px screen.   </p>
<p>Enter responsive web design! The main concept of RWD is that sites will work at any screen size (they &quot;respond&quot; to changes in resolution). This means that, rather than having a mobile version, a desktop version and a tablet version of your site, there is one golden design that is shown to all devices.   </p>
<p>If this concept twists your mind, take a look at <a href="http://mediaqueri.es/">mediaqueri.es</a>, a directory of great responsive designs. Alternatively, visit one of the sites in the first paragraph and try resizing your web browser to see what happens.   </p>
<h2 id="designing-responsively">Designing responsively</h2>
<p>A phrase often heard when talking about responsive design is &quot;mobile first&quot;. Generally, this is the idea that rather than building a website for a desktop screen and scaling down, you should start with a mobile version and scale up. It&#39;s a nice idea, but I dispute its helpfulness when trying to create a full site. My approach is much more of &quot;content first, on all screen sizes&quot;; I believe that your content should lead your design and, rather than focusing on mobile, you should always be considering every possible resolution.   </p>
<p>I&#39;m sure this concept wouldn&#39;t fly for a lot of people, since it makes design development very much a bit-by-bit process, as each small element of the site is organised. I find it to work well though and particularly like that, since each part of the site is responsive in itself, I can cut and change elements a lot more casually.   </p>
<h2 id="responsive-quizzard">Responsive Quizzard</h2>
<p>When I started <a href="/projects/introducing-quizzard">Quizzard</a>, I was immediately aware that I wanted a responsive site. Here I&#39;ll take you through the example of a forum thread on Quizzard, and how my &quot;content first, on all screen sizes&quot; policy applied to it.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1194" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forum-contrast.png" alt="A forum thread on Quizzard seen on a desktop and on a mobile device." width="1330" height="664" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forum-contrast.png 1330w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forum-contrast-300x150.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forum-contrast-768x383.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forum-contrast-625x312.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1330px) 100vw, 1330px" /></p>
<p>Above you can see a thread on Quizzard&#39;s forums (albeit a fake one) shown on both a desktop and a mobile device. Hopefully it&#39;s immediately obvious that the two screens show exactly the same content, they just present it slightly differently. This demonstrates the &quot;content first&quot; belief. My most important goal here was that every screen would show the posts, and who wrote them. I&#39;ll do another blog post in the future about how this fits in to my thoughts on forum design in general.   </p>
<p>However, note how both the screens show the thread in different ways. On the desktop screen, I&#39;ve used the extra width to throw a card to the side with the user&#39;s details on it. On the mobile screen, this information appears above the post and takes up noticeably less of the screen. This is the essence of designing responsively: Start with the content, work around it, and work on every screen size at once.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m really happy to introduce a new project that I&#39;ve been working on for a while, which hopefully will be a lot of help to a lot of people. It&#39;s called <a href="http://quizzard.co.uk/">Quizzard</a> and it should change the way that many of us do pub quizzes.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1196" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-icon.png" alt="Quizzard - Icon" width="113" height="36" />   </p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Firstly, a little bit of explanation of my history with quizzes. Early in my first year of university, we found that near our accommodation was a student union with a regular Monday night quiz. This was the Pleasance Pub Quiz, supposedly one of the biggest weekly quizzes in Europe. We went to this every week, with varying team members, and it&#39;s how I got to know loads of my very close friends.   </p>
<p>After two years, the quizmaster at Pleasance left and the university put out an open call for anybody to take over and, as a fan, I applied. Skip forward a year and a half and I&#39;m still there, now writing the questions and working the desk at Pleasance with Innes, our other quizmaster.   </p>
<h2 id="enter-quizzard">Enter Quizzard</h2>
<p>This is where Quizzard comes in. Each week, me and Innes end up writing our halves of the quiz, emailing them back and forth and trying our best to end up with a cohesive set of questions to ask each Monday. This has never been a perfect solution and, as a web developer, I figured I should just make something to fill the gap.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1193" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-app.png" alt="Quizzard - Plain app view" width="1350" height="682" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-app.png 1350w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-app-300x152.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-app-768x388.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-app-625x316.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" />   </p>
<p>As I started development I realised that others could probably benefit from the service and started to make a more coherent platform, and expand what it did.   </p>
<p>As well as writing quizzes, I want Quizzard to be a great resource for quizmasters and quizlings (people who go to quizzes) alike. For quizmasters, I&#39;m adding forums for us to discuss cool question ideas, hints and tips for running quizzes, and research sources. For quizlings, I&#39;m adding public listings so that you can quickly find an event near you. I love pub quizzes and really want to help get people through the door.   </p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1195" src="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forums.png" alt="Quizzard - Content-driven forums" width="982" height="489" srcset="https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forums.png 982w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forums-300x149.png 300w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forums-768x382.png 768w, https://wp-data.gregtyler.co.uk/files/2018/12/qu-forums-625x311.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" />   </p>
<h2 id="the-present-and-the-future">The present and the future</h2>
<p>Quizzard is currently in a testing mode, so it&#39;s locked down to just a few people at the moment. Soon we&#39;ll be adding more folk manually, and slowly expanding our user base.   </p>
<p>In the long term, I want to let people sign-up fairly freely, but want to personally approve every account to ensure that users are real quizmasters. It may seem heavy handy, but I want to support the quiz community and so that&#39;s my focus. There&#39;s also the question of whether to charge for the service. I need to offset the cost of running Quizzard somehow, and I don&#39;t think adverts would be particularly suitable. Charging for use of the service seems like a reasonable solution, but at the moment I&#39;m not focusing on that.   </p>
<p>So keep an eye on <a href="http://quizzard.co.uk/">Quizzard</a>, and watch this blog for future updates. Also, why not leave a message below if you have questions or comments about its future? In particular, if you&#39;re a quizmaster who would be interested in helping test Quizzard, please get in touch!   </p>
